Nothing is known of its breeding biology. The lone male in captivity lived for 2 years having matured after 18 months. This seems to be the normal among males of this genus. Longevity of the female is unknown, but if it is similar to other species, then they could survive for 10-12 years reaching maturity at the age of 5-7 years.","Habitat loss and degradation are major threats. From our understanding, if the habitat is under similar pressure of degradation, the species might be extirpated from the known location in the near future.

This lack of records despite these surveys indicates that its population, if extant at all, is likely to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no subpopulation greater than 50 individuals. A continuing decline is inferred from the lack of any recent records (Nandini and Mudappa 2010). Its distribution and ecology are effectively unknown, because there are no reliable documented records, ever, of the species in the wild (Nandini and Mudappa 2010). The species is known only from eight specimens collected over a century ago and four more recently, with the last in 1989 (Nandini and Mudappa 2010).","There is no reliable information about Malabar Civet's habitat use or other aspects of its ecology. The several descriptions of habitat use are speculative or based in whole or part on confusion with other species. It seems that it once inhabited lowland forests, lowland swamp and riparian forests in the coastal plain districts of the Western Ghats. Village reports suggested occurrence in thickets in cashew plantations and in highly degraded lowland forests in northern Kerala (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). It could possibly occur in lowland riparian forests in the coastal plain districts (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Based on the natural history of congeners, the species is probably nocturnal, ground-dwelling and readily camera-trapped when present.<br/> <br/> Natural forests have completely disappeared from the coastal Western Ghats. Present vegetation is secondary in origin (Champion and Seth 1968), and is mostly plantations (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Of these, cashew plantations are the least disturbed, because they are not weeded, providing a dense understorey of shrubs and grasses for this ground-living species to take refuge in (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). The pelt records from 1980-1990 were in the region of river valleys, suggesting a possible association with shallow water courses (Ashraf <em>et al</em>, 1993). The closely related Large-spotted Civet is strongly associated with the forested level lowlands (e.g., Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014); whether this is also true of Malabar Civet, which occurs within a rather different small carnivore community (notably, no other species of <em>Viverra</em>&#160;overlaps with it) is unknown.","Assuming habitat use similar to that of&#160;Large-spotted Civet,&#160;Malabar Civet&#160;is likely to have undergone a massive<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;decline<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;a century ago because of extensive conversion&#160;of forest to agriculture.&#160;Coastal plain forest was never extensive in&#160;its presumed range&#160;because the Western Ghats hill range run quite close to the coast along its&#160;length.&#160;Natural forests have completely disappeared from the coastal Western Ghats (Champion and Seth 1968).&#160;Land-use and habitat changes have not been too drastic in the last century within the assumed distribution range of the Malabar Civet.&#160;The records late in this period, if they were of wild animals, therefore suggest an ability to persist in today's habitat matrix, specifically in deforested areas and/or forest above the plains. In either case, many areas of potentially suitable habitat persist. Thus, habitat factors alone are unlikely to have been an unlikely driver of<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;of its present extreme rarity.&#160;There may be significant loss of natural and semi-natural habitat over the next decade with many hydro-power projects being proposed in the region. Cashew plantations, which might hold most of the surviving populations of this species, are threatened by large-scale clearance (Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993).&#160;<br/> <br/> The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this&#160;species's range&#160;during 1965-1970 (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the past, this species might have been used to collect civet oil, although there are no records to authenticate this claim. Small Indian Civet is still illegally ‘farmed’ and kept in captivity to extract civet, and any remaining Malabar Civets are likely to be at risk for the same reason.&#160;<br/><br/>Villagers report retaliatory killings of civets, taken by the interviewers to include Malabar Civet, for raiding poultry – although there is no hard evidence this species is killed for this reason. Once again it might be a case of mistaken identity between Malabar Civet and Small Indian Civet or even Common Palm Civet.&#160;The most recent skins apparently came from outside protected areas, suggesting that hunting is likely to remain a threat to this already rare species (Ashraf <em>et al</em> 1993). There are a few&#160;protected areas&#160;in the lowland of Kerala, but whether the species inhabits them is unknown.&#160;This species is not selectively hunted, but 10 of 22 reports of animals assessed by Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1990) to relate to this species and made&#160;during 1950 to 1990 were caught by dogs;&#160;there is no evidence that these reports actually relate even in part to Malabar Civet. Whatever the proportion of report of retaliatory killing and hunting that truly relate to Malabar Civet, that these practices occur in the species's presumed range means that they are likely to threaten any remaining&#160;Malabar Civets.</span>","The population status is unknown but the lack of any even possible record since the advent of widespread camera-trapping suggests that very few animals, at most, persist. Three recent attempts to find the species failed (Jayson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/> <br/> This species was formerly believed to be very common in the districts of Malabar and Travancore in southwest India, based on Jerdon (1874). However, Nandini and Mudappa (2010) concluded that&#160;Jerdon’s statements were a case of misidentification of the more common (even now) Small Indian Civet, supporting Pocock’s (1933) doubts about Jerdon’s report. But by the late 1960s it was thought to be near extinction. No sighting was claimed until 1987; then, and subsequently, there have been no confirmed records of wild or captive animals: only equivocal sightings&#160;(without any supporting evidence to confirm the species identification)&#160;and dead animals plausibly from captivity (Nandini and Mudappa 2010).",Decreasing,"Malabar Civet is believed to be endemic to the Western Ghats of&#160;southern&#160;India. All records lack precise locality (historical&#160;specimens all came from zoo animals with no information on original&#160;source)&#160;and most have little or no information on origin. Taken together they suggest a distribution in the lowlands from Kanyakumari in the extreme south north to Wayanad, Coorg, and Honnavar in Karnataka (Pocock 1933, 1939, Corbet and Hill 1992, Nandini and Mudappa 2010). There are only two reports of its occurrence in the higher elevations (over 600 m) of the Western Ghats, in the High Wavy Mountains (Hutton 1949) and at Kudremukh (Karanth 1986). The former is very likely to be in error and the latter was&#160;based on a single-observer sight-record left unidentified for some years&#160;(Nandini and Mudappa 2010). By the late 1960s, the&#160;species&#160;was thought to be near extinction. In the decades until the late 1980s, there were only two possible records, from Kudremukh in Karnataka (Karanth 1986) and from&#160;Tiruvella in Kerala (Kurup 1989); both lack objectively verifiable evidence.&#160;Rai and Kumar (1993) reported possible occurrence in the&#160;state of&#160;Karnataka based on the sighting by Karanth (1986) and unsubstantiated interviews with local hunters.&#160;In the late 1980s, skins of recently killed Malabar Civets were obtained in Elayur, in the lowland Western Ghats, in Malappuram district, Kerala (Kurup 1989) and near Nilambur, northern Kerala (Ahsraf <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993), although&#160;these&#160;seem subsequently to have been lost.","The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this&#160;species's range&#160;during 1965-1970 (Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993).

This species is not known to occur in any protected area and the declaration of large new protected areas in its range is unlikely because of the dense human populations (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Ashraf <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. (1993) recommended the following conservation actions for this species: captive breeding (with the possibility of reintroduction if suitable undisturbed areas are identified), field surveys (to investigate whether this species occurs in protected areas) and ecological studies (to determine the threats to this species). An urgent conservation action plan is needed. Given that recently it has been not possible to find the species at all, the option of captive breeding is not currently practical. Reintroduction, assuming that some environmental threats have dissipated the populations, it would need considerable amount of work to nullify those threats having firstly established what they are. Field survey should be continued, although many in the last decade have not yielded any positive results (Jayson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 2009). As noted by Nandini and Mudappa (2010) in a detailed review of the knowledge of the Malabar Civet, none of the historical specimens have reliable provenance; and even for the more recent ones it is fairly vague: not one has&#160;a precise wild locality of origin. It therefore is imperative to assess the status of the specimens&#160;in various museums and collections using advanced techniques of molecular genetics.

The Telagu-Ganga canal, which would have passed through one of these protected areas, was realigned in response to lobbying that it would fragment habitat, but in 2005 unauthorised work began again on the canal.

It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered.  <p></p> <p></p>","It inhabits lowland dry, or seasonally inundated, natural and semi-natural grasslands, often interspersed with scattered scrub or patchy open forest. Some Indian populations appear to be resident, but the species may make short distance movements away from breeding areas with the arrival of the monsoon as vegetation becomes too dense for it (R. Jha <em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). These movements may take the species into areas of low human density with short-grazed grasslands and low-intensity agriculture (A. Rahmani and R. Jha <em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). In Cambodia, the species is known to make relatively local seasonal movements in response to the flooding regime of the Tonle Sap lake: in the dry season, the species breeds in grasslands in the inundation zone of the lake and then moves to nearby agricultural and degraded deciduous dipterocarp forest during the wet season (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016). During the breeding season, males preferentially select habitats related to low-intensity human activity, chiefly burned grassland, whereas females primarily select unburned grassland, but also use unburned, uncultivated grassland in dry-season rice head-ponds (Gray<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2009), although anecdotal evidence suggests that eggs are laid in small pockets of medium to tall grass in recently burnt areas (R. van Zalinge <em>pers. obs.</em>).<br/><p></p>","In South Asia, most populations are small, isolated and vulnerable to local extirpation. The key threats are the extensive loss and modification of grasslands through drainage, conversion to agriculture and plantations, overgrazing, inappropriate cutting, burning and ploughing regimes, heavy flooding, invasion of alien species, scrub expansion, dam construction and inappropriate and illegal development (Brahma and Lahkar 2009, Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Ibbett <em>et al. </em>2017). In particular, the spread of dry season rice cultivation in Cambodia is rapidly converting existing grassland habitat (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). An increase in the area of scrub vegetation between 1995/1996 and 2005 was responsible for 65% of grassland loss in Cambodia (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Land sales and concessions are often pushed through despite resistance from local villagers (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Excessive hunting for sport and food may have triggered the species's decline, but owing to advocacy and law enforcement this is no longer a serious threat, at least in Cambodia. Other threats may include human disturbance and trampling of nests by livestock. Detailed research into the species's ecology in Cambodia demonstrated that the effects of human disturbance are weak and annual burning is important for maintaining suitable habitat, supporting the idea that community-based grassland management that maintains traditional agricultural practices will benefit the species. This has implications for management in South Asia, where remaining (and declining) populations are largely confined to strictly protected areas in which such practices may not be occurring (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Further study has revealed that, whilst burned grassland is selected by males during the breeding season, unburned grassland and other habitats providing cover are selected by females, demonstrating the need for management that provides a variety of habitats (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009b). Proposed development of powerlines in Cambodia could prove to be a significant emerging threat to the species there (Mahood <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><p></p>","The population in Cambodia was estimated at 294 displaying males or c. 600 individuals in 2009 (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2009a), but recently an extensive survey has reported a total of only 432 individuals (95% CI 312-550) (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). 75-96 individuals remain in Nepal (Baral<em> et al. </em>2013). No recent total population estimates are known from India, but &gt;100 males were recorded in the country in recent surveys, with the population in D'Ering Wildlife Sanctuary potentially holding 50-60 territorial males (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). Given these estimates, the total global population for this species is tentatively placed in the range 250-999 mature individuals. This equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species&#160;has two disjunct populations, one in the Indian Subcontinent, the other in South-East Asia (BirdLife International 2001).

It has declined dramatically and only survives in small, highly fragmented populations; although modelling work suggests that there are large areas of suitable habitat that could contain larger populations, especially in areas around the Brahmaputra River (Jha <em>et al. </em>2018).

Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). Additionally, island surveys of the Brahmaputra River in 2015 revealed the presense of 5-6 birds in as many river islands, while 12-15 adult male birds were found on the Sadia plains and river islands (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Arunachal Pradesh, 5-7 male floricans were seen in a private grassland in Nizambhat, and a new population with up to 29 territorial males was found in April-June survey in 2016 in D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary in East Siang District (Rahmani 2016). It is estimated that 60-70 territorial males could be present in D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary, making it one of the most important areas for <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">floricans in India (A.

In Uttar Pradesh, India, the numbers appears to have declined, as only 8 territorial males were seen in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, down from 24 seen in 2001, while a small population of 5-6 males was found in Pilibhet Tiger Reserve. As females are extremely difficult to see, their number was not recorded as part of these surveys.&#160;An estimate from 2007 put the Nepalese population at just 28-36 mature individuals (restricted to a few widespread sites) (Poudyal 2007), down from 32-60 individuals in 2001. Recent intensive survey effort in Nepal has recorded 47 individuals in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, including 14 birds outside any protected area and an estimate of 60 individuals in total (Baral <em>et al. </em>2013). This is almost double the numbers from a survey of the area in 2012 when around 12 pairs were estimated (Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012), but this is due to a more rigorous survey methodology (Baral <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;This is the largest population in Nepal (Baral <em>et al. </em>2013) and, if numbers from the 2007 survey are still accurate, this would put the total number of mature individuals in Nepal at 75-96.&#160;<br/>The South-East Asian population occurs in <strong>Cambodia</strong> and may be extant in southern <strong>Vietnam</strong>. The population in the Tonle Sap region, which supports the vast majority of the population of Cambodia, was estimated at between 312 and 550 based on surveys in 2012, with only 216 displaying males recorded (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). This represents a 44% decrease from the previous survey in 2005, and a minimum of 294 displaying males had been recorded in 2007 (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009a). If the population continues to decline at the current rate, it may become extinct in Cambodia within 10 years (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). More than 80% of the Cambodian population occurs on seasonally inundated grasslands within Kompong Thom province (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016). This estimate, based on the extent of available habitat in 2005 and known habitat loss between 2005 and 2007, represents a rapid decline owing to habitat loss, from a projected 3,000 individuals in 1997 (T. Gray, T. Evans and H. Chamnan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006). Given accelerating post-2005 grassland loss of 28% within 10 grassland blocks holding 75% of the estimated population (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a), and a further 11% of habitat lost in four protected areas in 2008 (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009), projected rates of decline will equate to over 80% during a three generation period (T. Gray, T. Evans and H. Chamnan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006). Recent assessment of habitat loss indicates that it has indeed been widespread and extensive between 2005 and 2012, and a number of sites identified as having blocks of grassland in excess of 10 square kilometers now contain little or no grassland (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013). Stoung-Chikreang BFCA and unprotected grasslands at Sankor support the highest populations (45 and 69 displaying males respectively in 2014), but estimates vary from year to year and population of the two sites is probably 100-150 displaying males (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Annual monitoring of Bengal Florican populations in Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs) and adjacent areas in Cambodia during March-April 2008-2016 indicates that whilst populations in some protected areas are stable, in other locations population declines are ongoing. Outside of protected areas there is very little suitable grassland habitat remaining (Mahood<em> et al.</em> 2012). <br/><p></p></span>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. Several populations occur within protected areas, the most important being the Bengal Florican Conservation Area (BFCA) network in Cambodia (see Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012), Chitwan National Park, Royal Bardia National Park and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, Nepal, Kaziranga, D'Ering, Dibru-Saikhowa and Dudwa National Parks, India. Tiny, perhaps unsustainable populations may still remain at Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Reserve, Cambodia, and within the Mekong Delta at Boeung Prek Lapouv Sarus Crane Reserve, Cambodia, and Tram Chim National Park, Vietnam. A research project investigating movements and habitat requirements in the non-breeding season began in 2007, where individuals were fitted with satellite or radio transmitters; the data from which have revealed previously unknown non-breeding sites (see Packman 2009). The Wildlife Conservation Society, BirdLife International and their government partners are engaged in a programme of conservation activities in the Tonle Sap floodplain of Cambodia, aimed at reducing habitat loss and hunting pressure on the species (A. W. Tordoff <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Achievements so far include the designation of 173 km<sup>2</sup> of breeding and 138 km<sup>2</sup> of non-breeding habitat as Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs). Populations in the BFCAs and in adjacent areas have been monitored annually since 2008 using a survey which employs a randomised sampling design to measure occupancy of 1 km<sup>2</sup> squares by displaying males, which allows results to be extrapolated within and across sites to obtain accurate population and trend data. These data indicate that the population is probably stable at some BFCAs and possibly declining in others and in adjacent areas (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009, 2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Suitable habitat in BFCAs continues to be lost to various threats, including the expansion of dry season rice cultivation and dam construction (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2010), although overall habitat loss outside BFCAs has been much greater. <br/><br/>Work is on-going to maintain effective management structures for these areas and build constituencies of support for their conservation among local stakeholders. Official patrol teams are now operating in Kampong Thom and Siem Reap, and in both provinces the Forestry Administration, working through provincial commissions, has already halted several proposed developments which would otherwise have destroyed vital breeding habitat (Eames 2007, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, 2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Changes in land use in the Tonle Sap floodplain and in the BFCAs in particular are also monitored with the aid of aerial and/or satellite images (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). When land encroachment in the BFCAs is detected through patrols or satellite-monitoring, WCS facilitates meetings between the parties concerned to resolve disputes and reverse encroachment. An in-depth socio-economic study has been conducted by the Centre d'Etude et de Développement Agricole Cambodgien. The report highlights the economic benefits local communities derive through the traditional use of grasslands and is used to build support among key decision makers and local communities. An awareness programme covering 71 villages and over 3,200 people was conducted in 2008/2009, and outreach activities in schools and villages are ongoing. Training in selected villages was conducted to improve agricultural systems and reduce the immediate pressure on grasslands from people wanting to convert grasslands into agriculture (BirdLife International 2009). Villagers receive financial rewards for reporting nests which they incidentally find as a deterrent against collecting and eating the eggs; finders receive an additional financial reward if the nest fledges successfully, although nest-finders are discouraged from protecting the nests directly to reduce accidental disturbance to birds (van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). <br/><br/>At the four breeding season BFCAs, community management committees have been established to act as intermediaries between WCS, government partners and the communities, they assist in awareness raising, patrolling and reporting illegal activities in the BFCAs. At one of the BFCAs rice is purchased at a premium from local farmers abiding by conservation agreements under a wildlife-friendly rice initiative and community members gain an additional income from acting as guides to birdwatchers visiting the site through the Sam Veasna Centre. These activities appear to be having some early success in arresting the rapid decline of the species in Cambodia, but their long-term outcome remains to be seen.<br/><br/>In 2012, a Darwin Initiative project was initiated to look at the species's distribution and habitat requirements in India and Nepal (Barber 2013). In Nepal, two male birds were satellite-tagged in April 2013 (Barber 2013), followed by two females and a male in 2014 and three males in India in 2014 (Barber 2014), and a further two males have been tagged in Nepal and one male in India (R. Jha&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). As a result of the tagging work, conservationists will be able to identify important areas for the species and propose suitable management regimes. Trial habitat plots have also been established to understand habitat preferences.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue annual monitoring of the population in the BFCAs, Cambodia, and replicate the monitoring protocol in key sites in India and Nepal. Conduct research on breeding productivity and habitat utilisation in breeding and non-breeding BFCAs. Introduce a protected area management regime, including appropriate rotational burning, grazing and cutting based on research findings; and promote appropriate land-management actions in non-protected areas, e.g. low intensity agricultural areas that are used in the non-breeding season (see Jha <em>et al.&#160;</em>&#160;2018). Promote grassland conservation awareness initiatives in all range countries. Strengthen the legal protection for existing BFCAs and expand the network (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2009, 2010, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Continue surveys for populations, particularly in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve and Koshi Barrage, Nepal (Poudyal 2007). Identify additional important sites for birds in the non-breeding season in Cambodia. Land acquisition outside the BFCA network and/or conservation concessions may be required to protect important areas for the species (Handschuh 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Extend, upgrade, link and improve enforcement in protected areas in India and Nepal, and establish new ones. Devise and promote a conservation strategy for all Asian bustards. Share best practice guidelines for management of small bustards in grassland habitats across Europe and Asia. Encourage community engagement to try to improve the level of protection within protected areas, and investigate potential initiatives to promote conservation-friendly development, such as the Sustainable Rice Platform (Ibbett <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><p></p>",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

From its reproductive dynamics, this is a species that is slow to recover from population impacts, even by tortoise standards. An 80% decline over the past three generations is a minimum estimate for total population reduction; remaining subpopulations may continue declining in some areas as human population grows, converts more forest, and harvests more animals. This species qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered under criterion A2cd.</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Elongated Tortoises inhabit primarily deciduous forest types (Sal, Dry Dipterocarp, Mixed Deciduous forests) with open, broken canopy allowing sufficient light for a moderate to very dense undergrowth of grasses and herbs; during the dry, leafless season animals may retreat to evergreen stream gallery forest. Records are mostly from hilly areas from low altitude to about 600 m altitude. In the Himalayas it has not been recorded over 500 m (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018). In Cambodia they are considered predominantly a lowland species in gentle sloping terrain. Local and seasonal movements are modest and seemingly random, tortoises apparently being confined to particular areas by features of habitat and topography (Moll 1989, Das 1991, van Dijk 1998).&#160;<em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is primarily crepuscular, with activity in the early morning and late afternoon, avoiding extremely high air temperatures of up to 48°C in the forest in the middle of the day. During periods of inactivity, tortoises retreat into dense vegetation, alongside fallen debris, in buttresses of trees, in caves or burrows. The species appears to have large home ranges (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2014), signifying a need for large areas of suitable habitat to be protected. Historically the species has benefited from disturbance of evergreen forest in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam, as it prefers primarily deciduous forest types (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Elongated Tortoises consume a wide diversity of foods, feeding mainly on soft leaves and fruits, while mushrooms, carrion and carnivore scats are eaten when available. (van Dijk 1998).<br/><br/>Elongated Tortoises of both sexes reach maturity at about 20 cm carapace length and a weight just over 1 kg, at an estimated age of 10-14 years (van Dijk 1998). Maximum size is usually 30 cm, but exceptional animals reach 35 cm carapace length. Hatchling size is approximately 4-5 cm (S. Schoppe pers. comm. 2018). Females produce one or possibly two clutches of 1-5 eggs towards the end of the rainy season (van Dijk 1998). Generation length is estimated to be a minimum of 30 years, but is likely to be substantially longer.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>The foremost threat to <em>Indotestudo elongata</em> has been the intensive collection almost throughout its entire range for trade to East Asia, starting in 1989 the intensity of which has started to decline only since 2016. The volumes of trade may have appeared to reduced, but investigations into captive farms and legal trade reveal that trade levels&#160;for these sources may be higher than reported.<br/><br/>This intensive commercial exploitation came on top of the impacts from long-term (decades to centuries) low-intensity collection for subsistence consumption throughout its range (review in Das 1991, Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). In India, <em>I. elongata</em> is associated with Sal forest (<em>Shorea</em> spp); Sal flowers are collected for pharmaceutical purposes, leading to extensive opportunistic collection of tortoises. However, deliberate hunting also occurs, often with the aid of dogs (Pawar and Choudhury 20000; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2012). The species is collected both for local use and international wildlife trade. In the 1990s <em>I. elongata</em> was considered to be the most common chelonian species in the Vietnamese wildlife trade (Hendrie 1998), and large numbers have been reported in trade in Cambodia (Ihlow and Dawson 2016). Worldwide, a total of at least 918 live specimens, in 20 shipments, were reported as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000-2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73). The Elongated Tortoise is also available in the international pet trade. However, the impact of trade as pets in minimal compared to the volume of trade for food (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Animals in Nepal, northeast India and Uttar Pradesh, are extensively traded for release at religious institutions; presumably as a result of targeted collection for this purpose.<br/><br/>Habitat impacts have been extensive as deciduous forests have been logged and cleared for settlement with seasonal, dry-land (slash and burn) agriculture; available habitat for the species has shrunk by more than half in the past 50 years in Thailand, and this percentage is probably comparable in other range countries, and even higher rates of habitat loss in Cambodia. Remaining habitat including in managed protected areas is widely impacted by human-associated wildfires, which create very high mortality among juvenile tortoises, to the extent that a population may be reproducing but is barely recruiting (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). This species appears to be absent from areas of dense human population and intensive cultivation (Ihlow<em> et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Other threats to&#160;<em>I. elongata</em> are minor and localised in comparison, with reports of decorative masks produced from the carapace available for sale in Nepal, although the species is not particularly favoured for this purpose (Mitchell and Rhodin 1996).&#160;</p>","<p>Despite having a wide distribution, and considerable suitable habitat remaining, severe population declines has occurred recently due to human activities (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2016). Scattered available information indicates that the species is depleted and now uncommon to rare throughout its range; survey findings consistently conclude that the species is rare and declining in India and Bangladesh (Moll 1989, Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). A 50-70% decline in population is believed to have occurred in the India/Bangladesh part of the range in the past 20 years (S. Singh pers. comm. 2018). There have been a few reports of <em>Indotestdo elongata</em> individuals in Bhutan's Royal Manus National Park but abundance is low there (Wangyal&#160;<em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>The best subpopulations in Thailand were estimated to have a density of one or a few animals per km<sup>2</sup> (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). The sex ratio in this population was also heavily female biased at 1:2.45 (van Dijk 1998). The species is somewhat abundant within protected areas in Thailand, but is collected for consumption outside of protected areas. Habitat destruction has led to a severe reduction in population in northeastast Thailand (M. Cota pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In the latter part of the 20th century <em>I. elongata</em> in Lao PDR and Viet Nam were already scarce and localised (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018). Throughout most of Cambodia and parts of southern Viet Nam, the species was relatively widespread and common. Subpopulations in Lao PDR and Viet Nam and Cambodia have since been severely depleted and possibly locally extirpated.<em> Indotestudo elongata</em> is not uncommon in Myanmar, and subpopulations appear to be relatively stable (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). In Bangladesh, <em>I. elongata</em> is relatively common in good habitat, but not in areas of habitat degradation (S.C. Rahman pers. comm. 2018). The species' survival is not compatible with human land use (other than responsible tourism in national parks) and will eventually become exclusively restricted to protected areas throughout its range. Overall, a population reduction of 80% is suspected to have occurred over the species range in the past three generations (90 years) as a result of habitat loss and harvest for food.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia. The western most limit of the species range is in in Kaleshar Wildlife Sanctuary in the foothills of Himalayas in the Arravali Range. It has localised occurrences in northern and eastern India, Nepal and Bangladesh, Bhutan and much of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, and scattered occurrences in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and extreme northwestern Peninsular Malaysia (Iverson 1992). Records from PR China (Guangxi) are derived from market animals. In Nepal,&#160;<em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is restricted to the terai vegetation zone; much of the terai has been converted to agriculture, and the species is now restricted to terai habitat in Chitwan National Park. A disjunct subpopulation occurs on the Chota Nagpur Plateau in eastern India, which appears to have been isolated from the Himalayan foothills by the alluvial plain and changing environmental conditions after the formation of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (Ilhow<em> et al.</em> 2016). Connectivity across the Brahmaputra is uncertain, as there is potentially a connection from the Himalayan foothills through the Sal forest belt to Orissa.</p>","<em>Indotestudo elongata</em> has long been used by humans as a source of food. Currently, <em>I. elongata</em> is heavily exploited for food and traditional medicine throughout its range (Ihlow&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Both opportunistic collection and deliberate hunting with dogs continue for local use and export to the international wildlife trade (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the 1990s <em>I. elongata </em>were common in the Vietnamese wildlife trade and in Cambodia. It has often been reported as one of the most abundant species available in China (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).This species is also available in the international pet trade, however, the impact is small compared to the volume of trade for food and medicine. Currently the demand for pets in the United States and Europe is mostly met by captive breeding, however, some wild-caught animals still occur (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Indotestudo elongata</em> is included in CITES Appendix II, allowing international commercial trade in the species provided such trade is not detrimental to the species, and subject to national trade legislation. It is also included in Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (amended), which lists species that require a small game hunting license to allow collection and local trade; the species may warrant transfer to Schedule I, which would afford stricter protection. In Thailand, the species is protected from exploitation under the WARPA law. Protected under government Decree 32 Group 2B (2006) in Viet Nam. Wildlife conservation act 2010 in Peninsular Malaysia. Wildlife Act 2012 in Bangladesh. It is not effectively protected in Indochina.<br/><br/><em>Indotestudo&#160; elongata</em>&#160; has&#160; been&#160; recorded&#160; from&#160; many&#160;protected&#160; areas&#160; across&#160; its&#160; range,&#160; including: Lawachara&#160;National Park in Bangladesh; Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, Central Cardamom Protected Forest,&#160;Prey&#160; Lang&#160; forest,&#160; Phnom&#160;Nam Lyr Wildlife Sanctuary,&#160;and Virachey National Park in Cambodia;&#160;Jim Corbett National Park, Rajaji&#160;National Park, and Simlipal National Park&#160;in India; Nakai Plateau Protected Area in&#160;Laos; Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary; Rakhine Yoma Elephant Reserve, and Natma Taung National Park&#160;in Myanmar;&#160; Sakaerat&#160; Biosphere&#160; Reserve and Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in&#160;Thailand; and Cat Tien&#160;National Park in Viet Nam. This species is also suspected to exist in the protected foothill forest in the Transboundary Manas Conservation Area (Ahmed and Das 2010). Although it occurs in many protected areas, there is not always effective protection on the ground.<br/><br/>This species is the focus of conservation projects at the Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity (ACCB) at Kbal Spean, Cambodia and the Turtle Conservation Centre (TCC) in Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam. Work at both ACCB and TCC includes the rehabilitation and captive breeding of tortoises confiscated from illegal trade (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Safeguarding the integrity of large areas of protected areas including corridors (poaching prevention, management of forest fire, boundary protection) throughout the range of the species is probably the single most important factor to ensure the species’ survival. Commercial trade in the species must be restricted to captive-bred animals, and trade must be monitored carefully. Further status surveys are needed.</p>",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

This is compounded by the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within two or arguably three generations time, that derivatives of this species are used in traditional medicine in China, both legally and illegally, and being promoted as a means of economic growth in the country and along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which could increase demand for the species and its parts, and there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives are effective, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest.<br/><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/>Currently, only Hong Kong and Taiwan, and potentially Bhutan, are parts of the range where overexploitation is not thought to be a threat to the species.","<p>This species is found in a wide range of habitats, including primary and secondary tropical forests, limestone, bamboo, broad-leaf and coniferous forests, grasslands and agricultural fields (Chao 1989, Gurung 1996). The species digs its own burrows, or enlarges passages made by termites (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005. Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Mro hunters in Bangladesh reported that a pangolin can excavate up to 15 burrows in a single night (presumably feeding burrows) and that resident burrows can extend up to 10m deep (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). This study also revealed that like the Indian Pangolin, the Chinese Pangolin will create an earthen wall once in a resident burrow which likely aids in predator avoidance (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Indications are that home ranges are relatively large. In Taitung, Taiwan, the home range of a male was estimated 96.0 ha (100% MCP) or 66.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel; n = 1) and 14.3-30.3 ha (100% MCP) or 15.9~19.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel) for females (n = 6) (Lin, 2011) </p>  <p>The Chinese Pangolin is solitary, primarily nocturnal (sometimes crepuscular), and largely terrestrial although it is fully capable of climbing trees and, like other pangolins, swims well (Heath and Vanderlip 1988; Chao 1989). Little is known about the species' life history, although in China (including Taiwan [Province of China]), young (normally one and occasionally two) are reportedly born from August to February (Allen and Coolidge 1940, Liu and Xu 1981, Shi and Wang 1985, Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al.</em> 1993, Chin<em> et al.</em> 2011). Hunters in Viet Nam reported that they never find this species in trees and it seems likely that it is far more terrestrial than the more arboreal Sunda Pangolin (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>Lin (2011) reported that there are two type of burrows that Chinese Pangolin use, namely feeding burrows and resident burrows. Feeding burrows are created by feeding on subterranean termites and are mainly used once. Lin found no statistically significant difference between the frequency of forest and more open habitats. Resident burrows are used for shelter and resting and sleep. A male pangolin can occupy ~80 resident burrows in its home range and a female has ~30-40 resident burrows. Different individuals may use the same resting burrow but very rarely on the same day.</p>  <p>Sun <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported the nursing period of the wild Chinese Pangolin was 157 days. The infant pangolin was observed exiting the nursing burrow alone at 11 weeks old and exploring behaviors such as s soil scraping and licking were recorded. In addition, the exploring behaviours were observe while the mother had left the burrow. The growth rate of was estimated at a constant rate of 1.2 cm/week during the nursing period, which was much faster than the only record from a hand-reared individual (0.7 cm/week; see Sun <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>  <p>The diet consists of ants and termites and it has been noted that in China, there appears to be a close correlation between the Chinese Pangolin's distribution and that of two termite species (<em>Coptotermes formosanus</em> and <em>Termes</em> (<em>Cyclotermes</em>) <em>formosanus</em>) which are assumed to form a major component of the diet (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Individuals are prey selective but known prey species include <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes, Camponotus mitis, C. nicobarensis, C. variegatus dulcis, Polyrhachis demangei, Aphaenogaster exasperata, Crematogaster dohrni</em>, and termite species <em>Macrotermes barneyi</em> : this is based on analysis of stomach contents (see Lee <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p><br/></p>","The primary threat is indiscriminate hunting and poaching, both targeted and untargeted, for local and international use, with the latter primarily driven by demand in China, and the species is subject to very heavy collection pressure across much of its range (Wu and Ma 2007, Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018). As has occurred historically, exploitation for nutritional, medicinal and spiritualistic purposes takes place locally (Anon 1999, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017, D'Cruze et al. 2018). However, evidence suggests that local use is now frequently forgone in favour of entering animals into national and international trade given their high financial value (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, MacMillan and Nguyen 2014). International use involves trafficking of the species and its derivatives despite the species being included in Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated that between 2000 and 2013 international trafficking in this species potentially involved ~50,000 individuals, though the actual number between 2000 and 2018 is higher (see Challender <em>et al.</em> 2019). In China and Viet Nam, the meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat for which affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in traditional medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (e.g., Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission, 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Other threats include infrastructure development, habitat loss and fragmentation, and pesticide use. In China, major developments including hydropower stations and mining also pose a threat.<br/>Taiwan and Hong Kong are exceptions where populations are not threatened by heavy hunting or poaching. The threats here include predation by feral dogs, roadkill and development, i.e. conversion of land for human use. In Taiwan, research suggests that Chinese Pangolins can become trapped in burrows or tree hollows, and is a cause of mortality, as is their capture in gin traps (Sun<em> et al.</em> 2019).<strong></strong><em></em>","<p>There is very little information available on population levels at any level (local, national or global) with few exceptions, and there is a paucity of research on abundance. This species is rarely observed, principally due to its increasing rarity, but also because it is secretive, solitary and primarily nocturnal. Evidence indicates it has been extirpated from parts of its current range as a result of over-exploitation, and is otherwise in steep decline across most of its range (Zhang 2008, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al</em>. 2017). An exception is Taiwan where populations are suspected to be stable and potentially increasing.&#160;</p><p>China comprises the largest range state for this species, but populations have suffered severe declines in recent decades. Between the 1960-1980s up to 160,000 Chinese Pangolins were harvested annually in China for consumptive use resulting in all but the commercial extinction of the species by the 1990s (SATCM 1996, Zhang 2008). We <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that populations declined by 88-94% between the 1960s and 1990s. In 2002, Wu <em>et al.</em> (2002) estimated populations in China to comprise 50,000-100,000 individuals, and in 2008 China’s then National Forestry Administration (NFA; though now National Forestry and Grassland Administration [NFGA]) estimated the national population to comprise 64,000 individuals. In contrast, Zhang<em> et al.</em> (2010) estimated the population in China in 2008 to comprise between 25,100 and 49,450 individuals. Also in 2008, the NFA (2008) estimated the population of Guangxi Province at 990 individuals with a density of 0.043 individuals/km². Interviews as part of research in China in recent years indicate this species is present but very rare in the border areas of Guangxi and Yunnan provinces (P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data), but at some sites (e.g., Dawuling Natural Reserve and Luofushan Natural Reserve), new burrows have not been seen in approaching twenty years indicating extirpation, and it is suspected that the species has been extirpated from Jiangsu, Henan and Shanghai Provinces (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005, Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010). Between 2015 and 2016, more than 20 natural reserves were surveyed in southern China, but found no fresh burrows or live individuals (F. Zhang and Q. Wang, unpubl. data). Li et al. (2018) estimated that in eastern China (Fujian, Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces) the species’ range contracted by 52% between 1970s and 2000s, and populations are now largely confined to the Wuyi Mountains. On Hainan Island, extensive field research between 1997 and 2013 and interviews with hunters and local people indicate the species is of very low abundance and likely commercially extinct (Nash <em>et al. </em>2016, P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data). In Hong Kong SAR, the species is present but is considered rare (G. Ades, pers. comm).<br/></p><p>In Taiwan (P.R. China) reports from the late 1980s and early 1990s suggest that populations of the nominal subspecies, the Formosan Pangolin were decreasing due to overexploitation from hunting and populations are were greatly reduced (Chao&#160; 1989, Chao <em>et al. </em>2005). After the Taiwanese government established the Wildlife Conservation Act in 1989 it appears that domestic consumption was significantly reduced. Evidence suggests populations are stable if not increasing in Taiwan and poaching is no longer the main threat. In southern Taiwan Pei (2010) estimated densities of 12-13 individuals/km². Kao <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated very approximately that the meta-population in Taiwan may comprise 15,000 individuals - though this estimate should be treated with extreme caution given significant knowledge gaps in parameters used to inform the models used to produce this estimate.</p><p>The species is very rare in Viet Nam. There are records from the past three decades from various protected areas, including Ba Na NP (Frontier Viet Nam, 1994), Cuc Phuong NP, Khe Net Nature Reserve and in Ke Go Nature Reserve (see Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). However, hunters in three areas of Viet Nam reported that although they still find the Chinese Pangolin it is extremely rare and populations have declined dramatically in the last two decades (i.e. in the 1990s and 2000s; see Newton <em>et al. </em>2008). In Khe Net and Ke Go, hunters reported that numbers of Chinese Pangolins were lower than those of the Sunda Pangolin probably because the former is easier to capture. If this is the case, then in places where both species occur, populations of the former are likely to be more heavily depleted (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008).</p><p>The species has been so heavily hunted in Lao PDR that field sightings are exceptionally rare. There were field sightings of an individual in Nam Theun Extension PNBCA (Proposed National Biodiversity Conservation Area) in 1994-1995, and an individual was seen in a village in Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA during the same period (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). There are unverified camera trap records from Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA in the early 2010s (Coudrat, 2017).<br/></p>  <p>In Bangladesh, Chinese Pangolins in the southeast may have disappeared (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), however, there are still a few areas where they exist, such as within the Chittagong Hill Tracts where there is an absence of high-skilled hunters (Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017). In this area, there was consensus among hunters interviewed that populations in the south has been extirpated as a result of overexploitation from poaching since 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Populations in Bangladesh are suspected to be declining.</p>  <p>This species was reported in the 1980s as common in the undisturbed hill forests of Arunachal Pradesh, however, little is known about the total population in India (Tikader 1983, Zoological Survey of India 1994). However, trafficking figures suggest this species is under severe hunting pressure in Northeast India (Misra and Hanfee 2000, Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/></p><p>Surveys conducted in the Royal Nagarjung Forest in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the early 1990s determined that there was a healthy population there (Gurung 1996). Nepal's population has been loosely estimated at 5,000 individuals but is suspected to be declining as a result of overexploitation (Jnawali <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p><p>There is little information on the status of the species in Thailand and Myanmar. There is a potential record from Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar form post-2000 (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, southern Bhutan, north and northeastern India, northeast, northwest and southeastern Bangladesh, northern and western Myanmar, to northern and Annamite regions of Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, part of northwestern Thailand, and across southern China. In China it occurs south of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) and on Hainan, Taiwan (P.R. China) and Hong Kong SAR. The species has likely been extirpated from parts of its current range, the limits of which are poorly known and may never be elucidated, due to high levels of exploitation historically. However, Taiwanese pangolin populations have stabilized in the last two decades and may even be increasing. The species occurs at high altitudes, especially in the southern and western parts of its range. In Nepal it has been recorded up to 3,000 m asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data), though also occurs at much lower altitudes, for example in Hong Kong and likely in the northeast of its range. Its latitudinal range is thought to overlap considerably with that of the Sunda Pangolin <em>Manis javanica</em>. Where this is apparent it is hypothesized that the Chinese Pangolin occurs in hills and mountains and the former is more generally found at lower altitudes (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Viet Nam interviews with hunters in 2007 (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008) suggested that the two species can be found in the same areas of forest, and that the differences between them are ecological, relating to diet and habitat use, rather than altitude, but ecological differences between the species have yet to be fully elucidated. <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>  <p>In China the species' distribution extends from the southern border as far north as the Changjiang, including on the island of Zhoushan at the mouth of the Changjiang (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Its distribution extends to the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Huibei, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Fujian, and in the Autonomous Regions of Guangxi Zhuang, Tibet, and Hainan Island. Zhai (2000) suggest the species occurs in Xichuan county of Henan province, which would be the only record north of the Changjiang, but they provide little detail and this requires verification. In Hong Kong, the species has been recorded from the central and northeast New Territories and Lantau Island, but not on the smaller outlying islands (Shek <em>et al.</em> 2007); it occurs here at low altitudes (Reels 1996). In Taiwan (P.R. China), the species occurs on the periphery of the Central Mountain Range, the Western Foothill Range, the Taoyuan Tableland, the Ouluanpi Tableland, the East Coast Mountain Range, the Tatun Volcano Group, Taipei Basin, Puli Basin, and the Pingtun Plain (Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al</em>. 2005). The upper limit of occurrence in Taiwan is around 2,000 m asl (Chao 1989).</p><p>Beyond China, the species is distributed in northern and central Vietnam, from Ha Giang province as far south as Quang Tri Province, but is absent from the northeast coast (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is found in Cuc Phuong National Park, Khe Net Nature Reserve, and Ke Go Nature Reserve, and Ba Na National Park (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). In Lao PDR, the species has been recorded in the north and central parts, but there are too few locality records to determine the geographic and altitudinal range of the species in the country with any accuracy (Timmins and Evans 1996; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The species is plausibly widespread in northern Myanmar, although there are few records and its exact distribution is not well known (Salter 1983, Corbet and Hill 1992). There is a record from Karen State in the early 2010s (Moo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Rao <em>et al.</em> (2005) report a sighting of the Sunda Pangolin in Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar, but there is uncertainty over the species' identification (M. Rao, pers. comm.) and it is plausibly and perhaps more likely the Chinese pangolin. There are few records from Thailand but include those from Doi Inthanon (formerly Doi Angka) in Changwat, Chiang Mai (northern Thailand), sometime in 1937 and 1939 (Allen and Coolidge 1940) and Doi Sutep, Chiangmai (northern Thailand) in 1901.</p>  <p>In Bangladesh, the species occurs in northern, northeastern and southeastern parts of the country, including in the border areas with northwestern Myanmar and India’s Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram states. Two Chinese Pangolins were captured from northwestern Bangladesh in recent years but which is thought to be the result of flash flooding from India. The species has reportedly been extirpated from most protected areas in southeastern Bangladesh. However, it does occur in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (southeast), Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (northeast), and Thakurgao (northwest) but has been extirpated from some areas due to poaching since around 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). In northern Bangladesh, it may be restricted to the India-Bangladesh border area only (Trageser<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>  <p>The species is marginally present in northern India e.g. Vamiki Tiger Reserve, Bihar (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018). There are photographic records of the species in Bihar and it has been recorded in northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Sikkim and the northern part of West Bengal) (Tikader 1983, Zoological Society of India 2002, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). Chinese Pangolins also exist in Kaziranga-Karbi-Anglong landscape and Manas-Bhutan landscape and there are recent (post-2015) camera trap records from Manas National Park, India (D. Lahkar, unpubl. data), and reports of the species being present near Sirohi Wildlife Sanctuary, Bunning Wildlife Sanctuary and Yangoupokpi-Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary of Manipur, India (J. Sethy, unpubl. data). The species appears to be sympatric with the Indian Pangolin (<em>M. crassicaudata</em>)<em> </em>in the Neora Valley National Park (Mallick 2010) and Manas National Park (Lahkhar <em>et al.</em> 2018; Goswami and Ganesh 2014).</p>  <p>The species occurs in southern Bhutan (though potentially central and western areas only) and Nepal, where it is typically located between 555-1740 m Asl, though there are records from 3000m Asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data). A nation-wide survey of pangolins (see DNPWC and DOF 2018) in Nepal unveiled the occurrence of Chinese Pangolin throughout Nepal largely distributed in human dominated landscapes outside the protected areas, though it does occur in protected areas as well. This suggests that Chinese Pangolins are distributed across eastern, central and mid-western Nepal and the Mid hills of central Nepal harbors likely strongholds for the species. It has been recorded as present in the lower elevation belt of the Kangchenjunga Conservation Area, the Gaurishankar and Annapurna Conservation Areas, Makalubarun, Sagarmatha, Chitwan, Parsa and Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Parks, the Salyan district in western Nepal (Khatiwada <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160; It has been also recorded in the Suklaphanta NP in southwest Nepal within the last four years and in Jajarkot district in mid-west Nepal (H.S. Baral, unpubl. data). In Nepal, its distribution appears to overlap with the Indian pangolin in the south and west. The Chinese Pangolin occurs from Inner Terai to hills and mountains while the Indian Pangolin is confined to lower altitudes; however, ecological differences between are not fully understood. &#160;</p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup>","<p>This species has been hunted at a local level historically, both for the consumption of its meat as a protein source, and for its scales for use as an ingredient in traditional medicines among other spiritual and ritualistic uses (Anon 1992, Zhang 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). It has also been subject to international trade historically. Based on trade data from CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, this has principally involved scales&#160;or traditional medicines containing scales, as well as skins between the 1970s and the year 2000 (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015; Heinrich <em>et al. </em>2016). However, following population declines in China up to the mid-1990s (see Zhang 2008), a heavy unrecorded and seemingly illicit international trade in live pangolins has occurred between Southeast Asia and China since which has involved this species (Li and Li 1998,&#160;Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). In the year 2000, CITES introduced zero export quotas for wild-caught specimens of this species traded for commercial purposes. Despite this, illegal trade has continued post-2000 which is largely driven by market demand in China and mainly involves live animals and scales originating from Southeast and South Asia based on available evidence (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman, 2017). Trade in this species in particular appears to come from Myanmar (Challender and Waterman 2017). Although local use of pangolins also continues today, evidence suggests that this is often forgone in favour of selling the animals into trade, which is primarily destined to China (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; </p>  <p>In China, as well as Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat dish for which affluent consumers are willing to pay very high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers, as in Viet Nam. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em>et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>Other consumer countries include the United States which imported large quantities of derivatives including the Chinese Pangolin between 1985 and 20111 based on CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017).</p><p>There is ongoing local use across the species' range though quantifying this across the species' range is challenging. In Bangladesh, tribal communities believe that the use of pangolin meat can reduce their illness and the scales can keep away evil spirits. Local physicians also sell the scales by promoting their supposed supernatural medicine value, occasionally in cities. Trade routes exist between Bangladesh and Myanmar and pangolins are trafficked along these routes, mainly destined to China. In Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal, scales are worshipped as an incarnation of God during Tihar festival and are kept in homes to avoid evil spirits (P. Kaspal, unpubl. data). In Nepal, jhakris, local traditional healers have been using the pangolin for its supposed medicinal benefits for generations, but it is only recently that a booming trade has developed around the species which is threatening the specie. The species continues to be exploited locally for consumptive use in China (Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016), Viet Nam (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008), Bangladesh (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), northeastern India (D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018) and Nepal&#160;</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The species is present in a number of protected areas across its range including in Bangladesh:&#160;Chittagong Hill Tracts, Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017); China: Dawuling Natural Reserve; India: Vamiki Tiger Reserve (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018), Manas National Park (D.

It has already been lost from large areas of its range due to the loss of grassland habitat and is now restricted to few, widely separated breeding regions. The species appears to be in imminent danger of becoming extinct in Madyha Pradesh and only very few are breeding in Maharashtra, leaving only two states with populations larger than a hundred mature individuals. The total population size is now thought to be fewer than 1,000 mature individuals, down from over 3,500 in twenty years.<br/><p></p>","The species is a local migrant with movements apparently determined by rainfall patterns (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;As such migration is considered partial and opportunistic with birds concentrating in areas that receive more rainfall, however there is believed to be a fairly high level of site fidelity among males (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Virtually all of the breeding areas are on private or revenue lands (Narwade&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Breeding coincides with the south-west monsoon, May-September, with birds congregating in north-central and west India for males to perform extraordinary leaping aerial displays. It occurs in productive rain-fed grasslands greater than two hectares, in lowland areas (below 250&#160;m), particularly dominated by <em>Sehima nervosum</em> and <em>Chrysopogon fulvus</em>, with scattered bushes and scrub (Dutta <em>et al. </em>2018); with breeding areas coinciding with areas of black cotton soil (H. Yahya <em>in litt. </em>2016). It has also been recorded breeding in soybean <em>Glycine max</em>,&#160;mung bean <em>Vigna radiate</em>, Black gram or Urad Bean <em>Vigna mungo</em>, Sesame <em>Sesamum indicium</em>, groundnut <em>Arachis hypogea </em>and infrequently in sorghum <em>Sorghum vulgare</em>, maize <em>Zea mays</em>, sugarcane <em>Saccharum, </em>rice <em>Oryza sativa</em>, mustard <em>Brassica campestris&#160;</em>and wheat <em>Triticum vulgare&#160;</em>crops as well as grassland in forest plantations (Sankaran 2000, Narwade <em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2017).<br/><br/>Non-breeding season movements are poorly understood, but the species sometimes uses lightly wooded areas as well as grasslands and scrubland (Sankaran 2000). Individuals may disperse large distances from breeding sites, as far as southern and north India (Dharmakumarsinhji 1950, S. Narwade <em>in litt. </em>2020, eBird 2021), but others remain on or near breeding sites year round (eBird 2021).<br/><p></p>","<p>Severe hunting pressure, particularly of males for sport and also food (e.g. Kasambe and Gahale 2010), precipitated its decline. </p>  <p>More recently, the most significant threats to direct mortality are likely to be predation of chicks by feral dogs and adult mortality through collisions with energy infrastructure. The species also continues to be threatened by hunting in Nepal (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012), and eggs and females may also be collected within its range (H. Yahya and P. Patil&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Unethical photography were also identified as threats by Dutta&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018).</p>  <p>Declines have been caused by rapid reductions in the area of grassland owing to conversion to agriculture (with associated use of insecticides and fertilisers [H. Yahya&#160;<em style=""font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2;text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial;text-decoration-style: initial;text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing:0px"">in litt.&#160;</em>2016]) and overgrazing. This along with a&#160;lack of coordination between different implementing agencies, lack of participatory planning, rapid industrialisation and spread of mining and quarry activities are key growing threats to species (Dutta&#160;<em>et.al.</em>&#160;2013, Narwade&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;In many areas, 40-80% of grasslands have been encroached and converted to intensive agriculture (Sankaran 1995, Joshua 2011, Dutta and Jhala 2012) within the last 2-3 decades.&#160;In addition, the rapid spread of the non-native&#160;<em>Prosopis glandulosa</em>&#160;threatens habitat quality. Over the last two decades, unreliable monsoon rains have caused significant population fluctuations. In Nepal, the species suffers from disturbance and insufficient protection resulting in overgrazing and subsequent grassland degradation (Inskipp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2012). It is also seriously threatened by inappropriate management, such as ploughing in protected areas, leading to a loss of suitable habitat. Pressure on lowland grasslands in Nepal continues to increase, and now very small areas of suitable habitat remain, and these are almost entirely within protected areas (Inskipp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In addition, the invasive plant&#160;<em>Mikania micrantha</em>&#160;has had serious impacts on Chitwan National Park and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve. </p>","The total population has been calculated from a recent and robust survey over most of the range which estimated 340 displaying males&#160;(95% CI 162–597, Dutta <em>et al.</em> 2018). This excluded any birds in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh as the survey failed to locate any individuals (Dutta <em>et al. </em>2018), despite this 38-57 individuals (maximum 19 males) have been reported from these states for the 2018/2019 period (Pinjarkar 2018, Mishra &amp; Ghosh 2020). In addition, 6 males were present in Rollapadu Wildlife Sanctuary, Andhra Pradesh, in 2017, another region unsurveyed in the recent survey led by Dutta <em>et al. </em>(2018).&#160;Summing these values and assuming an equal sex ratio (a conservative assumption, as there may be multiple females per displaying male) the population size is therefore estimated to be 356-1,228 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 730 mature individuals.<br/>The methodology of the recent Dutta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2018) survey was designed to be comparable with that of Sankaran (2000), who estimated 3,530 mature individuals in 1999 (Sankaran 2000, Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). The population estimate in 1982 was 4,374 mature individuals (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1994).&#160;Assuming a linear rate of decline from the 1999 estimate (Collar [2021] indicates the rate is likely to be accelerating), the rate of population reduction over the past three generations (15.9 years) is equivalent to 89%, however, calculating an accelerating rate of decline by incorporating the 2008 estimate of 2,500 mature individuals&#160;(Dutta <em>et al. </em>2013) results in an estimated 93% reduction over the past three generations. Both rate of declines indicate extinction within a few years, as noted by Collar (2021).<br/>The remaining strongholds are thought to be Velavadar (Gujarat), with 96-115 displaying males where the population is concentrated in few sites at high density, and and Shokalyia-Bhinai (Rajasthan). In Rajasthan the population is dispersed across a large area at very low density where 110-136 males were thought to be present (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018), however, only 35-40 displaying males are counted annually since 2017 (S. Narwade&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2021).&#160;<br/>Displaying males continue to be observed in Maharashtra, despite not being recorded during the 2018 survey (Dutta <em>et al. </em>2018). 7-8 males and 20-22 females were reported from a conservation partnership with the Phasepardhi community&#160;(Pandharipande 2015, Pinjarkar 2018). In Madhya Pradesh, annual numbers reported by the Chief Conservator of Forests for 2015 to 2018 were 48, 39, 19 and 27, but only 11 were recorded in 2019 (Mishra &amp; Ghosh 2020) and only 5 in 2020 (Tomar 2020): this population is in imminent danger of being lost.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Sypheotides indicus</em> breeds in <strong>India</strong> in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra,&#160;Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh (Raha and Prakash 2001, Kasambe and Gahale 2010, Bhardwaj <em>et al. </em>2011, Anon. 2014, P. Patil&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016), with some dispersal to south-east India in the non-breeding season. It is a very rare summer visitor (&lt;10 birds) to the terai of <strong>Nepal</strong>, although there have been no records for a few years and was formerly recorded more frequently, but may have only been an non-breeding visitor, dependent on monsoon rains (Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016, C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). <br/><br/>Formerly widespread and common, it has been declining since at least the 1870s. From 1982-1989, its population declined by nearly 60% (4,374-1,672 birds). However, by 1994, it had increased by 32% to 2,206 birds. These population fluctuations are directly correlated with breeding season rainfall patterns, indicating that it is susceptible to extinction in the event of severe, prolonged drought. Recent surveys have indicated an extremely rapid reduction that has continued and appears to have accelerated over the past 20 years (Collar 2021) with very few breeding birds noted in Madhya Pradesh (5 breeding males in 2020 [Tomar 2020]), 6 males in Andhra Pradesh in 2017 (Dutta <em>et al. </em>2018) and 7-8 males in Maharashtra (Pandharipande 2015, Pinjarkar 2018). Loss from these states appears to be likely in the near future.<p></p>","The role of hunting and egg-collecting, while not quantified, is thought to be significant.

In Nepal, the species is protected at the national level (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). In 1994, a conservation strategy was published, which proposed management recommendations for fodder-producing grasslands and increased protection for natural grasslands. In 1996, several sites in Rajasthan were identified for intensive conservation action. Two Lesser Florican sanctuaries exist: Sailana and Sardarpur, both in Madhya Pradesh (Rahmani 2006), and the Government of Madhya Pradesh has instigated as reward scheme for farmers who help to protect this species (V. Jain <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. The species occurs in a number of other protected areas. In Maharashtra, a local NGO, Samvedana, has worked to involve local poachers in conservation actions for the protection of the species and its habitats (P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).&#160;Under BirdLife International’s Preventing Extinctions Programme a workshop was organised for Forest Department officials in Madhya Pradesh for Lesser Florican conservation. Rajasthan Forest Department has initiated measures to protect habitat for Florican in Sonkhaliya Florican area (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;The plight of this species highlighted by Dutta <em>et al. </em>(2018) instigated a number of local measures (Collar 2021): in February 2020, Bombay Natural History Society organised a farmers' meet to promote florican-friendly farming and publicised to villagers the plight of the Lesser Florican; in Kanakpar, the community has fenced a 16-ha plot, cleared invasive vegetation from it, and established a rotational grazing regime compatible with producing sustainable yields and providing florican breeding habitat. In Rajasthan, sterilisation programmes have proven effective at controlling dog numbers (Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2020).

It feeds on carrion, both putrid and fresh. While feeding considerable aggregations can form, and regular communal roost sites are used. It is social and usually found in conspecific flocks. It breeds in colonies in tall trees (e.g. in Himanchal Pradesh it is restricted to pine forest/plantations [Thakur 2015, M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016]), often near human habitation. Movements are poorly known, although satellite-tagged birds have shown that they will forage over a vast range. The degree of connectivity of apparently separate populations is not known. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, as they were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in South Asia. <p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported&#160;(Prakash <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2007, Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume. Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause&#160;renal failure resulting in visceral gout in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a<strong></strong>, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Green <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;<strong></strong>Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014). Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in <em>Gyps</em> vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (<strong></strong>Green <em>et al</em>. 2004);&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality and diclofenac being banned in several range states, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008)<strong></strong>, potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam,&#160;an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan <em>et al. </em>2006a, Swarup <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160;Additionally, large vials of diclofenac continue to be manufactured for human use, which are then distributed, sold and used for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;A second veterinary drug in use in India and particularly in Bangladesh, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo <em>et al.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Nambirajan <em>et al. in prep.&#160;</em>2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla <em>et al. </em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). One study recorded that the sex of fledglings, the sex of dead adults and the sex of adults with visceral gout were all male-biased which may lead to problems in the future (Arshad&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>Other likely contributory factors in South Asia are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers) and poison and pesticide use, but these are probably of more minor significance (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;&#160;In Bangladesh, 61% of cattle owners surveyed said that they now buried dead cattle or used them as food in shrimp farms, which could lead to a reduction in food supply for vultures (Khan 2013). Forest fires may also be a threat in some areas, for instance in the Himalayas, though this may need further study (M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016). Deforestation, electrocution and collision with energy infrastructure may pose additional threats in some parts of the range (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of deceased livestock reducing food availability (Clements <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong>. In Cambodia, vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides to kill stray dogs and for hunting wildlife (Loveridge <em>et al. </em>2019; Clements <em>et al. </em>2013; S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Loveridge <em>et al </em>(2019) recorded 15 vulture poisoning events in Cambodia during 2005-2016, resulting in the known deaths of 32 White-rumped Vultures. The same study also recorded the first confirmed vulture mortality from carbofuran in Cambodia. Additional threats identified in Myanmar include direct persecution of the species through nest destruction, hunting and poisoning and indirectly through a loss of food supply (Hla <em>et al</em>. 2011).<p></p>","Formerly described as possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world, with a global population almost certainly numbering several million individuals, this species suffered dramatic population declines during the 1990s across its range. There are now an estimated c.6,000 individuals in India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2019), &lt;2,000 individuals in Nepal (DNPWC 2015), c.100 individuals in Cambodia (Sum and Loveridge 2016), c.260 individuals in Bangladesh (MoEF 2016) and 250-350 individuals in Bhutan and Pakistan (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The total population is therefore estimated to be c. 6,000-9,000 individuals, equating to 4,000-6,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps bengalensis</em> occurs in <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong>, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong> and southern<strong> Viet Nam, </strong>and may be extinct in<strong> </strong>southern<strong> </strong>China and Malaysia (BirdLife International 2001). It has been recorded from south-east Afghanistan and Iran where its status is currently unknown. As recently as 1985 the species was described as ""possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world"" (Houston 1985)<strong></strong>. However, it disappeared from most of South-East Asia in the early 20th century and the only viable populations in the region are found in Myanmar and Cambodia, mainly in the north (both probably in the low hundreds of individuals) (Hla 2003, Anon 2003, 2005, Eames 2007a,b, Hance 2009)<strong></strong>. Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in this part of its range is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005),&#160;as well as the impact of poisoning events as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practises (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Since the mid-1990s, it has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 99%) across the Indian Subcontinent (the majority of its historic range), first noticed&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">by villagers in northern India in 1996-97 (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016), with further early evidence from&#160;Keoladeo National Park, India, and then throughout India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003, 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, Pakistan (Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006),&#160;Nepal (Baral <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012) and Bangladesh (Khan 2013)<strong></strong>, to the point that the species is highly threatened with extinction. Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,<strong></strong> Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004<strong></strong><em></em>)<strong></strong>. This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, 2004b; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Declines in India between 2000 and 2007 averaged 43.9% per year (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>, and ranged between 11%-61% in Punjab province, Pakistan over the same period (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, while surveys of 23 known colonies in Punjab province in 2006 found a total of only 37 breeding pairs (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In the lowland districts of Nepal the species declined at 14% a year between 2002 and 2011 (Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). In Bangladesh, the species declined by 60% between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 (Khan 2013), and the population trend in the country is still a decline (IUCN-Bangladesh 2016).&#160;The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan banned veterinary diclofenac in 2006 and the Government of Bangladesh followed suit in 2010 (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). Since then, the rate of decline appears to have slowed, and may even have reversed in India and Nepal (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012). Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population (minimum 201 individuals in 2010; 183 individuals in 2011 [Clements <em>et al. </em>2013])<strong></strong>. Census results from Cambodia suggest the population there may have been increasing since 2004, or is at least stable (Eames 2007b, Clements <em>et al. </em>2013, S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), while there may be some local increases in India (D. L. Bohra <em>in litt. </em>2016). A local increase has also been noted in Pakistan, though this may be more a result of immigration (Murn <em>et al. </em>2014). Surveys of vulture restaurants in Myanmar in 2006 and 2007 estimated a minimum of 62 White-rumped Vultures were present (Hla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices I &amp; II, Raptors MOU Category 3. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the veterinary use of diclofenac, and Bangladesh followed suit in 2010. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008)<strong></strong>. The availability of diclofenac in veterinary drug stores in Bangladesh decreased from 100% in 2008-2009 to 53% in 2011-2012 (Khan 2013). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on <em>Gyps</em> vultures with no ill-effects (Swan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Swarup<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, such as ketoprofen (banned in&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Coimbatore, Erode and Nilgiris<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Districts [Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2016])&#160;(Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are currently multiple Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014, SAVE 2015). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as supporting wild birds (R. Cuthbert <em>in litt. </em>2016). They can also bring in vulture-related income for locals, through ecotourism (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are increasingly used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range, particularly Cambodia and Nepal, to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). The exchange of diclofenac with meloxicam near breeding colonies is taking place in Nepal in combination with diversionary feeding with diclofenac-free carcasses (Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce but not eliminate vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, simultaneously censusing nesting colonies, vulture deaths and looking for diclofenac use (Eames 2007a).&#160;Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., and to aid the development of suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that vultures provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres, each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts are on-going and met with success when two chicks hatched in early 2007 at a breeding centre in Pinjore, Haryana (V. Prakash <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Three more birds hatched in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive flocks that will ensure the full geographical spread of the species is represented in captive breeding efforts (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. By April 2008, there were 88 in captivity at three breeding centres in India, as well as 11 at a centre established by WWF-Pakistan and 14 in captivity in Nepal (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. During 2009, these numbers increased to 120 in India, 43 in Nepal and 14 in Pakistan (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. In late 2009, trials of artificial incubation methods were due to start soon (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. By November 2015, the total number held in breeding centres affiliated to SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) stood at 218 birds at 3 centres in India, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015), of which 20 juveniles had successfully fledged (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012); and as of 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles of all three resident&#160;<em>Gyps </em>species&#160;combined (V. Prakash <em>pers. comm. per. </em>C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Six captive-reared birds were released in Nepal in 2017, followed by the first 8 captive-bred individuals and a further 4 captive-reared birds in September 2018 (SAVE 2018). Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Wildlife Trust of India and the Assam Forest Department (Wildlife Trust of India 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). An updated action plan for vulture conservation in India was written in 2020 (MoEFCC 2020). Cambodia and Nepal have updated their 10-year (2016-2025)&#160;(Sum and Loveridge 2016)&#160;and 6-year (2014-2019) action plans (DNPWC 2015), and in 2016 an action plan was produced for Bangladesh. In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;<em>A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered&#160;</em>Gyps&#160;<em>vultures&#160;</em>that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to measure the frequency of diclofenac and ketoprofen-treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and support species management or restoration, as needed. Strengthen public awareness and public support programmes, including providing veterinary camps and livestock management training (SAVE 2014). Monitor remaining populations, in particular continue activities in Cambodia and Myanmar. Monitor the sale of veterinary drugs, and contamination of ungulate carcasses/dead vultures (SAVE 2014). Provide supplementary food sources, with appropriately-sized carcasses, where necessary for food-limited populations (see Hille <em>et al. </em>2016). Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres with the aim of holding at least 150 pairs of each species in captivity (<strong></strong>Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2008, Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008). Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012). Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac, and improve its availability (SAVE 2015). Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones.&#160;Four additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide, flunixin and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2016), and support bans for these vulture-toxic drugs. Attempt to fully implement a restriction in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2011, SAVE 2014).

This species feeds almost entirely on carrion, and often associates with White-rumped Vulture <em>G. bengalensis</em> when scavenging at carcass dumps and slaughterhouses. It nests almost exclusively in colonies on cliffs and ruins, although in one area, where cliffs are absent, it has been reported nesting in trees. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, and were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India, which in turn reduces the amount of food available for potentially problematic species, such as feral dogs (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2012b).<p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Pakistan and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported (Prakash&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, 2007, Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality, with renal failure resulting in visceral gout found in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that have been treated with the drugs prior to death and left for scavengers to consume (as is tradition in Hindu cultures). Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs that then cause renal failure and death. Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in the species just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues <strong></strong>(Green <em>et al</em>. 2004),&#160;and sampling livestock carcasses in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations<strong> </strong>(Paudel 2008), potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam, an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006a, Swarup&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Recent bans of diclofenac in the region still have not eradicated its use in veterinary treatments, as it is still found in the carcasses of livestock and vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014, 2015). This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015). A second veterinary drug in use in India, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Nambirajan&#160;<em>et al. in prep.&#160;</em>2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Other possible contributory factors are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers), unintentional poisoning from consumption of poisoned baits intended for feral dogs or wild carnivores, electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure, disturbance from rock climbers at cliff nesting sites (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), drought (Hall <em>et al. </em>2012) and mining activity (Chhangani 2004).","Prakash <em>et al. </em>(2019) estimated the population to be c.12,000 individuals based on road transects carried out in 2015. This roughly equates to 8,000 mature individuals. It is placed in the band 5,000-15,000 mature individuals.&#160;<p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps indicus</em> breeds in south-east <strong>Pakistan</strong> and peninsular <strong>India</strong> south of the Gangetic plain, north to Delhi, east through Madhya Pradesh, south to the Nilgiris, and occasionally further south (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species was first recorded in Nepal in 2011 (Subedi and DeCandido 2013). It was common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 97%) throughout its range. This was first noticed in Keoladeo National Park, India <strong></strong>(Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003), where counts of feeding birds fell from 816 birds in 1985-1986 to just 25 in 1998-1999.

Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;There are currently 12 provisional Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce (but not eliminate) vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps</em><em> </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008).

Also, despite bans and the wide availability of meloxicam, diclofenac is still widely found in carcasses and vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014, 2016).&#160;This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015).&#160;Other veterinary drugs (ketoprofen, flunixin, nimesulide, aceclofenac and fenbendazole) have also recently been identified to be potentially lethal to vulture&#160;species (Naidoo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009,&#160;Zorrilla <em>et al.</em> 2015, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2016, Galligan <em>et al. </em>2016, Sharma 2016).<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably results from the collapse of large wild mammal populations due to overhunting and improved management of deceased livestock leading to scarcity of available food (Clements<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013), but persecution and poisoning is also thought to be a problem. In Cambodia vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides (S. Mahood&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012; Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Other potential contributory factors to declines in this species are direct persecution, pesticide use and electrocution/ collision with energy infrastructure (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017) but these are probably of minor significance.","Considerable confusion over the taxonomy and identification of <em>Gyps</em> vultures has occurred, making it difficult to be sure of the population size. In 2015, the population was estimated to be c.1,000 individuals in India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2019; MoEFCC 2020), 47 individuals in Cambodia (Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016), fewer than 50 individuals in Nepal (DNPWC 2015), and a single breeding pair in Bangladesh (MoEF 2016). Very little is known about the size of the population in Myanmar, however counts made at vulture restaurants during 2003-2006 suggest a population of c.21 individuals (Hla&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010). The total population is therefore thought to be c.1,100-1,300 individuals, roughly equating to 730-870 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps tenuirostris</em> is found in <strong>India</strong> north of, and including, the Gangetic plain, west to at least Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, south to southern West Bengal (and possibly northern Orissa), east through the plains of Assam, and through southern <strong>Nepal</strong>, and north and central <strong>Bangladesh</strong>. It formerly occurred more widely in South-East Asia, but it is now thought to be extinct in Thailand and Malaysia, and the only recent records are from <strong>Cambodia</strong>, southern <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Myanmar</strong>. Considerable confusion over the taxonomy and identification of <em>Gyps </em>vultures has occurred, making it difficult to be sure of claims for this species. However, it appears to be allopatric or parapatric with Indian Vulture <em>G. indicus</em> where their ranges abut (or potentially do so) in northern India. <br/><br/>It was once common, but in South-East Asia populations declined through the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, and are now probably very small and restricted in distribution and limited mainly to Cambodia (where the first nests recorded in the country were recently found and surveys in 2015 recorded a total of 47 individuals at vulture 'restaurants' [Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016]) and Myanmar (counts made at vulture restaurants suggest a population of c.21 individuals [Hla <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010]). Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in the region is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005). <br/><br/>In India and Nepal, the species was common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s it has suffered a catastrophic decline of up to 96.8%, with a combined average decline in India of this species and <em>G. indicus</em> of over 16% annually between 2000 and 2007 (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In Nepal the species was formerly fairly common and widespread, but during 2002-2011 it declined by 18.7% per year (Chaudhary&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), although there may have since been a partial recovery (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;It is now extremely rare in the east of Nepal and local and uncommon in the centre and west (Inskipp <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, <strong></strong>Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004,<strong></strong> Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005).<strong></strong> This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses, leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,b<strong></strong>; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Probably owing to the effects of diclofenac, breeding success in parts of its Indian range is reportedly low; of 14 nests found in Assam just four had chicks (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population. Likewise, surveys conducted in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007 found no firm evidence of diclofenac use (Eames 2007).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices I &amp; II, Raptors MOU Category 1. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the veterinary use of diclofenac, and Bangladesh followed suit in 2010. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India in 2008 warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, which is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert et al. 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on Gyps vultures with no ill-effects (Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert et al. 2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs (Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). Conservation activities include: meeting key groups (e.g. pharmacists, veterinarians and livestock owners); engaging government officials (e.g. drug control, livestock services and forest departments) at tehsil, district and state levels; engaging with the public (e.g. festival programmes, media coverage and signage); diclofenac-free district declaration; community-run formal or informal Vulture Safe Feeding Sites (i.e., vulture [Jatayu] restaurants); vulture-related income generation for villages at nesting or feeding sites; diclofenac-meloxicam exchanges; husbandry and veterinary training camps; and national and international ecotourism to feeding sites and conservation breeding sites (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). There are currently 12 provisional Vulture Safe Zones being established in countries including India, Nepal and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research - in Cambodia these are run by The Cambodia Vulture Conservation Project and a partnership between national and international conservation NGOs (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, H. Rainey <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., in order to develop suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that they provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts began in 2006 when 18 Slender-billed Vultures were captured for the captive-breeding facility in Pinjore, India. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. In April 2008, there were 28 birds at the three Indian breeding centres (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, increasing to 35 birds in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Two individuals bred in captivity for the first time in 2009. By November 2015, the total number in breeding centres in India was 218, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015).&#160;The Central Zoo Authority of India has also set up several Vulture Consevration Breeding centres (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<em>&#160;</em>A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive breeding efforts that represent the full geographical spread of the species (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Wildlife Trust of India and the Assam Forest Department (Wildlife Trust of India 2019).&#160;Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, accompanied by searches for nesting colonies, research into vulture deaths and investigation of possible diclofenac use in livestock (Eames 2007). <br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha et al. 2017). An updated 5-year (2020-2025) action plan has been produced for vulture conservation in India (MoEFCC 2020), a 9-year (2016-2025) action plan for Cambodia (Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016) and Bangladesh (MoEF 2016), and a 4-year (2015-2019) action plan was was written for Nepal but has not been updated (DNPWC 2015). In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered Gyps vultures that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Multiple Conservation Actions were proposed as part of SAVE (2014) and SAVE (2015). Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac (as well as the removal of human-use diclofenac in vials of &gt;3 ml), and attempt to implement a ban on other vulture-toxic NSAIDs. Regulate the production of veterinary drugs to identify vulture-safe NSAIDs. Support species management or restoration, as needed. Initiate public awareness and public support programmes. Identify the location and number of remaining individuals and identify actions required to prevent extinction. Monitor remaining populations, in particular replicate conservation and research activities in Myanmar that have been implemented in Cambodia. Provide supplementary food sources where necessary for food-limited populations in South-East Asia, and maintain and promote Vulture Safe Zones, including trans-boundary efforts. Within VSZs, promote livestock management training and provide free veterinary camps. Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres, and identify the most appropriate sites for release of captive-bred individuals. Attempt to estimate the potential value, in terms of ecosystem services, provided by wild vultures. Protect nesting areas.",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global
