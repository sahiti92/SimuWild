The species apparently is semi-fossorial and active mainly during the wet season; it appears to prefer stream edge habitats (Lucknow Red List Workshop participants Sept. 2005). Diet in the wild is unrecorded, captives accepted a variety of animal and vegetable foods (Das 1991).

Ganesh <em>et al.</em> (2017) reported that gravid females were active both in July, in the pre-monsoon season, and following the monsoon in December an February.","Habitat loss in the form of burning of grasslands and conversion into real estate, grazing and tapioca plantations, and multiple invasive plant species that increase fire risk and shade its sandy habitats. <em>Prosopis </em>is the most widespread of these, affecting most formerly suitable open habitat within its range. Sand quarrying in and around river beds and coastal dunes are causing population decline. The known distribution is almost entirely human-modified. This species only survives at all because of efforts to conserve the Black Buck along the Coromandel coastal plains, a species which is dependent on similar grassland habitat. Urban development and rural settlement threaten the species in Sri Lanka, although it occurs in habitat in this country that is not generally subject to major threats; on Mannar Island there are multiple widespread threats including wind power and tourist industry development.","This species is poorly-sampled and underrepresented in collections (Bauer <em>et al. </em>2010).

Animals spend their time mainly hidden among leaf litter, alongside tree buttresses, roots, lianas, fallen logs and other vegetation, or in tree holes or burrows (Das 1991, Deepak <em>et al</em>. 2014). These turtles are active, alert predators that feed on forest floor invertebrates, mainly insects and snails, as well as on fruits and other vegetable matter (Das 1991, Deepak <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Adult females have a carapace length of 11.4–13.9 cm and weigh 76–340 grams, males are&#160; smaller at 10.0–12.6 cm carapace length and 84–275g; hatchlings measure 37–40 mm carapace length (Deepak <em>et al</em>. 2014). Age of maturity may be about eight years; a generation length is estimated at 24 years (based on three times the age of maturity); it is difficult to estimate the age of longevity. Females produce one to two clutches, typically of two eggs, but a range from one to four eggs has been reported (Moll <em>et al</em>. 1986, Deepak <em>et al</em>. 2014). Females lay eggs in narrow crevasses under log and bark, and do not dig nesting chambers nor cover the nest with substrate or leaf litter (Das 2010).</p>","<p><em>Vijayachelys silvatica</em> is recorded as threatened by past forest destruction through logging and subsequent establishment of tea, coffee, cardamon and opium plantations and through wildfires (Das 1991).

Hydroelectric reservoir construction is likely to affect areas inhabited by the species; 24 reservoirs have been created in Kerala alone, with another 12 in the planning stage (Deepak <em>et al. </em>2014).

Females gestate for about 180 days, and usually give birth to one kid per pregnancy (Rice, 1984). Animals are sexually mature in the wild at around three years of age (Wilson, 1980; Rice, 1990), though they are only expected to live three or 3.5 years on average, their potential life span is at least 9 years (Rice, 1988; Rice, 1990). The species is diurnal, but are most active grazing in the early morning and late afternoon (Prater, 1971; Nowak, 1991).","Principal threats are habitat loss (mainly from domestic livestock and spread of invasive plants) and poaching (Daniels <em>et al</em>. 2008). The general trends of decline even in the best managed Tahr habitats indicate that the total population of the species does not exceed 2000 at present and a conservative estimate would place the numbers within the 1,800-2,000 range (Daniels <em>et al</em>., 2006). Currently, the only populations with more than 300 individuals are in Eravikulam National Park and in the Grass Hills in Anamalai. The most recent information from the Nilgiri hills (Mukurti Wildlife Sanctuary), which previously had more than 300 tahr (Davidar, 1978; Rice, 1984; Schaller, 1971), indicates that only between 75 and 100 individuals remain. Wattle (<em>Acacia mearnsii</em>) plantations and cattle apparently no longer threaten the Mukurti population, so their decline is probably due solely to illegal hunting. The status of the other smaller populations (many of which are less than 100 individuals), which are also subject to continued illegal hunting, can be considered precarious. Similar population decreases and threats to the species were reported in a survey in Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (Rai and Johnsingh, 1992).<br/><br/>Populations of these animals are small and isolated, making them vulnerable to local extinction. Habitat patches for Nilgiri tahr are naturally discontinuous, but some habitat fragmentation may have anthropogenic causes (C. Rice pers. comm., 2008). The species faces competition from domestic livestock, whose overgrazing has allowed for the invasion of graze-resistant weedy species into preferred meadows, thus in competition with the native grasses that tahr prefers (Mishra and Johnsingh, 1998).  Continued conversion of tahr habitat to agricultural land has resulted in a present distribution that is about one-tenth of its historical range (Mishra and Johnsingh, 1998; Kannery, 2002; IUCN, 2004).","Total numbers were estimated at between 2,000 and 2,500 individuals in the 1970s-1980s, and were thought to be stable (Davidar, 1978; Rice, 1988a, 1990). More recently Daniels <em>et al</em>. (2008) estimated the total population at no more than 1,800-2,000 individuals. An overall decline in the species was suggested by Daniels <em>et al</em>. (2008), although some populations appear to have remained stable in recent decades (Mishra and Johnsingh 1998). The species current populations are estimated to be Nilgiri hills (450, though now reduced to 75-100), Silent Valley (30), Siruveni Hills (20), Elival Mala (60), Nelliampathi Hills (30), Top Slip and Parambikulam (120), Eastern Slopes of Ananmala (125), Grass Hills of Anamala (250), Swamaimala (130) Eravikulam National Park (760), High Range (30), Palani Hills (60), Highwavy mountains (100), Mudaliar oothu (70), Vellakaltheri (90), Ashambu Hills (70), and Thiruvannamalai peak (40) (Nilgiri Tahr Trust, retrieved 02 January 2007).",Decreasing,"The present distribution of the Nilgiri tahr is limited to approximately 5% of the Western Ghats in southern India, in Kerala and Tamil Nadu in southern India (Shackleton, 1997; Grubb, 2005), although not along the border between these two states (M. Alembath pers. comm. 2007). At the beginning of this century the range of tahr probably extended northward at least to the Brahmagiri hills of southern Karnataka (Shackleton, 1997).  The animals are more or less confined to altitudes of 1,200 to 2,600 meters (Nilgiri Tahr Trust); populations as low as 900 m may or may not represent pre-human extent of occurrence in elevation (Rice, 1984).",,Terrestrial,"The Nilgiri tahr is fully protected (Schedule I) by the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, although this protection is rarely enforced and illegal hunting is a major threat (Kannery, 2002; IUCN, 2004).<br/><br/>The creation of Eravikulam and Silent Valley National Parks, Mukurti, Anamalai, and Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Srivilliputhur Grizzled Giant Squirrel Sanctuary and the Kalakadu-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, together offer an important degree of protection to the Nilgiri Tahr. Eravikulam National Park and its surroundings has been cited as having nearly 1,000 individuals (Kannery, 2002), although others have questioned this figure, believing it to be too high (Abraham <em>et al</em>. 2006, M. Alembath pers. comm., 2008). <br/><br/>The Tamil Nadu Forest Department is removing exotic monocultures along the periphery of the Mukurti National Park. In addition, institutions such as the Nilgiri Wildlife Association, High Range Wildlife Association, Ramnad District Wildlife Association, Kerala Forest Research Institute, Bombay Natural History Society and the Wildlife Institute of India, are active in promoting conservation of Nilgiri tahr. Conservation measures proposed: The Nilgiri tahr requires continuous study and monitoring, because its small and isolated populations are extremely vulnerable. With proper conservation, including habitat maintenance and minimising mortality due to hunting, it is possible that with time, the species could be considered no longer threatened, if the following are accomplished: 1) Establish the proposed Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. This would include the Bandipur, Nagarhole and Silent Valley National Parks, the Mudumalai, Mukurti and Wynad Wildlife Sanctuaries, the Bolampatti Reserved Forest and the proposed Karipuzha National Park (WCMC, 1988c), and encompass a Nilgiri tahr population of 400 to 450 individuals (Davidar, 1978; Rice, 1984). An extension to such a reserve has also been proposed (Rice, 1990) to include peripheral cliffs used by tahr as escape and birthing terrain. A revised biosphere reserve design of these conservation units has been suggested by Rodgers and Panwar (1988). 2) Enact management proposals that include the systematic monitoring of tahr populations, as well as possible re-introductions (Rice, 1988a, 1990; Rai and Johnsingh, 1992). There is good potential for re-introductions in areas such as the Kalakadu-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve where several highlands had small populations of tahr some 20 to 40 years ago, but today are very small or non-existent (Rai and Johnsingh, 1992). 3) Consider low impact recreational use (e.g. trekking, fishing) of suitable areas, especially where such activities would benefit (and compensate) the local economy for restrictions on traditional activities such as hunting by local inhabitants. 4) Co-ordinate Nilgiri tahr with other wildlife and habitat conservation efforts, because the Western Ghats are one of India’s major wildlife areas.",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

However, the populations in Jammu-Kashmir fit into the morphological and behavioural patterns of the type locality population, thereby these are now included within the <em>S. ajax</em> assessment. This additional range has increased the EOO and AOO for the species, but the number of mature individuals within the known distribution is still restricted and declining.</p>","<p>This species is found in pine, moist temperate and alpine cedar forest from 1,300 to 4,000 m.

Unimale-multifemale and all male bands have also been observed. Typically, these langurs are found in groups ranging between 25-40 individuals. But occasionally, as in one case in Chamba, they numbered over 100 individuals. In Dachigam, groups of over 500 individuals are seen together in congregation for a brief period during winter, after which they disperse into smaller groups (Mehreen Khaleel pers. comm.).

In Dachigam, they have been found feeding on bark/peel of&#160;<em>Ulmus villosa</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Ulmus wallichiana</em>. They also feed on seeds of&#160;<em>Rhus&#160;</em><em>succedanea</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Pinus wallichiana</em>&#160;in winters. Walnut (<em>Juglans regia</em>) also forms a large part of their diet in the months of August-September. They also known to lick mud and rocks. Cultigens are a substantial part of the diet. They are primarily arboreal but also spend a good part of their time on the ground. Infants with a more dark, brown fur were observed around March/April, so birthing could be around this time. In Dachigam, the greatest number of infants were found during Jan-March. Very little inter-group or intra-group aggression, if any, were observed. During the months of Nov-March when the groups fuse together, behaviour such as aggression (showing of teeth), chasing away the male, and mating take place. The animals, unlike their lowland congeners, do not vocalize the characteristic langur whoop but rather have a deep, grunt like bark. In Chamba they range from about 1,300 m to 3,000 m in sub-alpine cedar and oak forests (Anandam&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>, pers. obs.). In Kashmir, they range from about 1,600-3,000 m and prefer broadleaved deciduous forest habitats, one or two solitary males were found at 3,500 m during summer.</p>","<p>Molur&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2003) list the following past threats: overgrazing, building roads through&#160;forests, logging, deforestation, agriculture, and fire. Present and future threats include&#160;agriculture and development (Molur&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003).<br/><br/>The booming tourism industry around prime habitats like the Khajjiar-Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary is a serious threat. Unregulated tourism has ushered in some unwelcome practices such as non-biodegradable garbage disposal, tourist resorts and food-stalls or&#160;<em>Dhabas,&#160;</em>and loud vehicles through the park. Other such places around the state are now being identified as tourist hotspots therefore the threat is spreading to places new and far. Logging and lopping are other activities in the region but the impact of such activities on the population has not been assessed (Anandam&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Crop foraging is a growing threat across Chamba. In the 2012-2013 survey, 76 of the 244 sites surveyed across the district reported agricultural crop foraging and about 25% of the respondents expressed negative attitude towards langurs (Anandam&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013b). In Kashmir, villages nearby Dachigam, Overa and Hirpora WS reported negative intraction in the form of crop foraging during winter (Dec-Feb) and early spring (March-April). Survey conducted from 2015-2017 in eight districts of Kashmir namely; Pulwama, Srinagar, Anantnag, Shopian, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Budgam and Baramulla reported crop foraging in 7 out of 87 villages. In places close to Dachigam, people retaliate by throwing stones to shoo away the langurs back to protected area.<br/><br/>Due to change in land-use, people have started to grow apple orchards and vegetable farms in villages close to protected areas. This can be considered as a growing cause of crop raiding in places close to Dachigam. For the past three years, villages in Kangan area (District Ganderbal) in Kashmir have reported solitary males foraging on apple and walnut trees. These are usually single males or two. People show neutral attitude towards their presence as no large-scale damage was reported. Only 5% people reported conflict in the entire valley and shoo away monkeys from their fields.<br/></p>","<p>Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2003) estimated a total population of this species as fewer than 500 individuals (250 mature). The valley where it lives is surrounded by snow peaks and therefore it has remained isolated from other langurs, and the population is very small&#160;(M. Singh and C. Groves pers. comm). With the recent information from Dachigam National Park and other places within the Kishtwar Valley of Jammu-Kashmir indicating the population to be&#160;<em>S. ajax</em>, the numbers are estimated to be less than 1,000 mature individuals in the Kishtwar Valley. Dachigam holds the maximum number of mature individuals whereas, at other places the average troop size was found to be around 20-25. The total number of mature individuals is estimated to be less than 1,500 in number. Decline in the past is not known but it is predicted to decline by less than 10% in the next 10 years (Molur&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003).<br/><br/>There are very little data available on the population in Chamba, owing primarily to the steepness of the terrains and shyness of the langurs. But given the many developmental activities in the region, the consequent pressures on the forests, increasing negative interactions with humans, and increasing attacks of the langurs by dogs, one could safely presume that the population is threatened and potentially decreasing (Vishal Ahuja, pers. comm)</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is reported as occurring in northwestern India in Himachal-Pradesh and&#160;Jammu-Kashmir (Groves 2001). It is claimed by Brandon-Jones&#160;(2004) that this species occurs in Melemchi, Nepal. Morphological and behavioural studies indicate its occurrence is restricted only to the Chamba Valley in Himachal-Pradesh and Kishtwar Valley in Jammu-Kashmir. The species range is restricted (&lt;10,000 km²), and therefore also its area of occupancy (&lt;2,000 km²).<br/><br/>Following Pocock's (1928) description, the species is identified only from Chamba (Groves and Molur 2008). All the other populations are considered under the plausibility of variation and hybridization and therefore cautiously await taxonomic scrutiny and verification. Groves (2001) suggests a wide distribution range for the species, from Dehra Dun in the Doon Valley of Shiwaliks to Pakistani Kashmir. But Groves and Molur (2008) restrict the species to Chamba. The report of the species in Machiara National Park in Pakistan by Minhas <em>et al</em>. (2011, 2013) requires verification for species identity. Recent reports of the species from&#160;Dachigam National Park in Jammu-Kashmir&#160;in India (Mir&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2015, Mehreen Khaleel pers. comm., Junaid Shah pers. comm., P.O. Nameer pers. comm.), confirm the identity of the populations to match morphologically with the Chamba Sacred Langurs. The Dachigam population also lack whooping calls, exhibit grunts and teeth grinding like that of the Chamba Sacred Langurs (Mehreen Khaleel, pers. comm.). Therefore, the distribution here is restricted to Chamba and Kishtwar Valleys in western Himalaya. Based on photographs and direct sightings, the langurs from these places in the Kashmir Valley match morphologically with <em>S. ajax</em>: Wangat-Naranag CR, Kazinag NP, Rajparian NP, Overa WS, and Tral CR, all within Jammu-Kashmir.&#160;</p>",The species is not used for any purpose.,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I, and Schedule II Part I, of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 amended up to 2002 (Molur <em>et al., </em>2003). Except for Khajjiar-Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary, its occurrence in other protected areas is difficult to determine owing to taxonomic uncertainty. The following areas are in need of research: taxonomy, life history, survey studies, limiting factor research, behavioural ecology. The following management actions for the conservation of this species are needed: wild population management, monitoring, public education, and limiting factor management (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>The Himalayan Langur Project, established in 2012, is working across Chamba, with local communities and other stakeholders to establish a holistic conservation program and research on the langur.

The generation length is approximately 13 years.</p>","<p>The major threat to this species today is habitat fragmentation, with many of these fragments being further decreased. In the past, habitat loss was due mainly to timber harvest and the creation of exotic plantations such as tea, eucalyptus and coffee. Habitat degradation seems to the biggest threat to the conservation of Lion-tailed Macaques wherever they occur in Kerala (Easa <em>et al</em>. 1997). In private forests and plantations, change in land use is a problem for the species. Hunting is a second major threat, especially in certain parts of its range. In one location, Coorg, with a large area of remaining wet evergreen habitat, the species is highly threatened by non-subsistence and subsistence hunting for food (Kumara and Singh 2004). In some areas, primate meat is preferred as food, and so the animals face serious hunting threats (Kumara and Singh 2004).

There are estimated to be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals (Molur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Few subpopulations have the structure and habitat suitable for self-sustainment, where 10-15 groups share or connect their home ranges and interbreed.

This species experiences a considerable range in elevation of near sea level in the south to above 2,607 m in the north at Chendebji (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wangchuk <em>et al</em>. 2003). One isolated population is found in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, Nayakgaon, in the Kokrajhar district of Assam (Medhi&#160;et al. 2004). Study of this population has shown that the animals can withstand the effects of habitat change to some extent and survive in altered habitats (Medhi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). The diet consists of young and mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits, and seeds, with most feeding spent on young leaves (Gupta 1998, 2002). Subba (1989) and Subba and Santiapillai (1989), however, found that this species prefers fruits and buds to leaves. In forest fragments they may depend on cultivated crops such as tapioca, betel, and guava. It is diurnal and arboreal (Khajuria 1977).<br/><br/>Long-term field studies show that the species spends 12.8–33% in feeding, 40–63.14%in resting, 6.29–19% in locomotion, 5–11.54% in monitoring, 2–3.7% time in playing and 0.35–6% time grooming and other social activities (Mukherjee 1996, Chetry 2002, Biswas 2004, Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). The home range of the species varies from 2 to 58 ha depending on the habitat quality (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Being a folivore the principal share of its diet is leaves, yet they consume other food item like fruits, seeds, flowers and insects on a regular basis. The species spends 60% of the time on feeding leaves, 24.6% time on fruits, 5.99% time on petiole, 2.5% on flower and flower buds, and 2.56% on stem cortex and shoot. They were also reported eating gum, soil, algae and burned wild potatoes and arium, snail (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Chirang Reserve Forest, the buffer between Manas and Ripu-Chirang Elephant Reserve, the langurs were seen to feed on <em>Cryptocoryne retrospiralis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>","<p>Due to habitat destruction, the populations of this species are restricted to fragmented forest pockets, especially in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em> 2004). Habitat destruction is the major threat to this species in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em> 2004). Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em>&#160;2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava <em>et al</em>., 2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and logging, woodcutting and domestic fuel wood collection have severely affected the habitsats of the species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2001). The political unrest, the settlement of&#160; refugee in the habitat, developmental activities , shifting cultivation, commercial logging, rubber plantation, contributed the habitat destruction of the species (Chetry <em>et al</em>., 2010).&#160; Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.</p> <p>Recorded forest cover lost during 1997-2001 has been reported in the following as Chirang Reserve Forest (593 km<sup>2</sup>) reduced to 393 km<sup>2</sup>, and&#160;Bengaltal Reserve Forest reduced to 5 km<sup>2</sup> during this period and similar trend was reported throughout the distribution range in India except in protected areas. The habitat is still under tremendous anthrpogernic pressure in the form encroachments, expansion of agricultural activities&#160;and other development activities are existing&#160;and which is expected to&#160;continue in future too.&#160;There was massive habitat loss between 1989 and 2000, which resulted in severe fragmentation into 19 pockets where the Golden Langur survived until sometime and eventually disappeared (Choudhury, 2002).</p> <p>Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for this species: “Crop plantations, grazing, harvesting non-woody vegetation for firewood and charcoal production, selective logging, timber collection, human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, trade, killed by domestic dogs, habitat loss, high juvenile mortality, inbreeding, and local trade in live animals as pets and in road shows. Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J. Das pers. comm.).&#160;Poisoning due to organochlorine insecticide is another threat to the population as witnessed in a rubber plantation in Kokrajhar, Assam (Nath and Chakraborthy, 2011).</p><p>It is suspected that the rate of decline in India is well above 60%, definitely more than in Bhutan; but given the overall disturbance in both the countries due to increasing number of development projects, damming, conversion of forests for settlements, cultivation and plantations, the destruction of habitat is on the increase and is expected to continue into the future for another two decades at least at the same rate.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>A total of&#160;5,141 individuals in 566 troops were sighted in&#160;India in mid-to-late 2000s (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ghosh <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 6,637 individual reported from Bhutan in early 2000s (Wangchuk 2003). Demographic trends indicate a decline in the population of this species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001). Groups were bigger and densities higher in areas of more degraded habitat (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001), however, owing to disturbance and felling, the langurs remained in higher densities&#160;for quite some time but currently they have totally disappeared from degraded habitats. The langurs near the National Highway such as Bismuri and other places have vanished. The high density was due to crowding from sudden habitat loss and degradation. The langurs survived for quite some time in such habitat as the local people generally do not kill for meat unlike many other areas of northeastern India (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>The population has declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years, and is expected to decline further in the near future due to various threats outlined by field biologists in both India and Bhutan (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Population densities in Manas National Park, and Ripu and Chirrang reserve forests are 8 ind/km², 46 ind/km², and 64 ind/km², respectively. The Golden Langur Conservation Project saw a rise in the langurs population across the range in India, from 1,500 in 1997 to 5,600 in 2007–2012, and in Bhutan, estimated to be 6,600 in number. Estimated range size at present is 1,506 km². The density has also significantly increased from one individual/km² to 3.71 individuals/km² in 2009. Distribution&#160;area&#160;in the protected area and outside protected area in India is 1,993 km² and in the protected areas of Bhutan is 2,992 km² (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2010). Overall there is no increase (except in some pockets) but populations have declined sharply in areas such as Chirang RF. In 1997 count, the coverage was poorer than in 2007-12, hence larger population in 2007–2012&#160;(Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019). <br/><br/>Populations of Golden Langurs in smaller fragments have lower nucleotide diversity than those in larger fragments.

Its distribution in Bhutan is limited to the foothills of the Black Mountains (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001, Chetri and Chetri 2009). The total known range of this species in both India and Bhutan is less than 30,000 km², and much of it is not suitable habitat (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001).

It is also listed on CITES Appendix I (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). The Chakrashila Wildlife Sanctuary is the only protected habitat for this species in India (Medhi <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, Srivastava <em>et al</em>. (2001) reports that the species is also found in Ripu, Chirrang, and Manas Forest Reserves. Yet these reserves are unstable, and the complete protection of Manas National Park is needed (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). By upgrading the protection and status of this species, it is believed that isolated populations can be linked through corridors that will prevent genetic fragmentation (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). A long-term study is needed to assess the actual impact of habitat alteration on the species over long periods of time (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Medhi <em>et al.</em> (2004) suggest the following actions to protect the population of this species in Nayakgaon: insulation or diversion of electric lines, motivate villagers to restrain their dogs, planting of trees to develop a corridor between the Nayakgaon population and the Chakrashila population, a long term study of behaviour and ecology, and regular monitoring of the population. <br/><br/>Chetry and Chetry (2009) suggested habitat conservation, forested corridors linking the fragments, habitat restoration of the degraded forest, wild to wild translocation of isolated populations, community participation in forest management and trans-boundary&#160;conservation programme for the conservation of the species.

It has also been noted in bamboo “brakes” and hollock (<em>Terminalia myriocarpa</em>) and ajhar (<em>Largerstroemia flosreginae</em>) plantations. One gibbon pair in the Borajan Reserved Forest (north-east India) was observed to habitually descend from the trees to move over scrub and short bamboo especially while trying to reach the isolated food trees inside a village. This pair was found sleeping at heights of 0 m or less in bamboo clumps (Kakati 1997). Although gibbons may be moving through, or sleeping in, bamboo forest or plantations, they cannot survive in monocultures (W. Brockleman pers. comm.). Additionally, the species has been observed in two plains forest locations (Choudhury 1991). Its preferred habitat, however, is dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (Choudhury 2001). It has been recorded at altitudes of up to 2,500 m in Manipur, northeast India (Choudhury 2001).<br/><br/>Home ranges in most populations range from 8-63 ha (Ahsan 2001, Alfred and Sati 1990, Muzaffar <em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160; Feeroz and Islam 1992,&#160; Islam and Feeroz 1992; Islam and Feeroz 1992a, Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996, Tilson 1979), but unusually large home ranges of 200-400 ha were reported from Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India (Mukherjee 19<em>96</em>). The western hoolock is a frugivorous species, with ripe fruits composing a majority of its diet (Ahsan 2001, Alfred and Sati 1990, Bin Muzaffar <em>et al.</em> 2007,&#160; Feeroz and Islam 1992, Islam and Feeroz 1992a&#160; Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996, Tilson 1979). A dominantly folivorous diet was reported during studies carried out in Assam’s Borajan Reserved Forest and in Tripura (Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996), and gibbons living in small forest fragments were observed to experience a period of almost total lack of fruit in their diet at the end of the dry season (Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996). Low fruit availability may contribute to the relatively large home range sizes of some populations. In northeast India, the hoolock gibbon is recognized as being an important disperser of undigested seeds from large and small fruit-bearing trees (Das <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In Bangladesh, the main threats are the combined effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, human interference and hunting (Islam and Feeroz 1992, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2005). Hunting is universal all over Bangladesh as well as India, and may be in Myanmar also. In China, the Tibetan population could be under threat from hunting for food or non-targeted hunting, but this is not established.<br/><br/>In some Indian locales, these animals are rare due to large scale hunting for food and because some ethnic groups believe the gibbons have medicinal properties (Gupta 2005, J. Das pers. comm). On the other hand, observations from Arunachal Pradesh (P.C. Ray pers. comm.) suggest that hoolocks are not hunted for subsistence, and may even be cherished. Density of gibbons is still high around tribal villages of several ethnic groups; the same is true in northern Myanmar. Additionally, jhoom cultivation threatens the habitats of Indian populations, some of which are relatively isolated already (Choudhury 1991). Affecting all northeastern Indian primate populations are harvesting of bamboo for paper mills, oil mining and exploration, and coal mining, which deplete habitat and cause pollution and disturbance (Choudhury 1991). Habitat fragmentation and loss are major threats in India (Kakati 2000). Small and restricted groups may not be viable because of genetic and demographic instabilities and because they are more affected by hunting pressure and habitat loss. Many small forest fragments are reported to have only one or a few gibbon groups. These have limited chances of surviving more than a few generations without translocation (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015, Das <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, shifting cultivation is a major threat, and so is hunting. Although logging is restricted on the western side of the Chindwin, it is still considered a threat for this species (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2013). Political and ethnic conflicts have prevented the Myanmar government from promoting development and conservation activities effectively in areas of northwestern and central western Myanmar along the borders with India and Bangladesh. Thus, most conservation efforts have been concentrated within the range of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em>.","There are estimated to be about 200-280 hoolocks in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2006, Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005). In China, a population has been identified in Medog Nature Reserve in southeastern Tibet, just across the border from Arunachal Pradesh, but the identity of this taxon is not established and there has been no survey conducted to determine the population numbers (W. Bleisch pers. comm).<br/><br/>This species occurs in several of India’s northeastern states, but populations there tend to be isolated. It is common in certain areas of occurrence, but rare in others due to intense hunting by local tribes (Choudhury 1991), and is considered rare throughout its range (Choudhury 2001). The species was found in all forested patches in northeastern India about 30 years ago, but they are reduced to a few forest fragments now. The total population in northeastern India is now estimated to be over 12,000, of which about 2,000 occur in the state of Assam (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005), and most of the remainder in Arunachal Pradesh. A population of about 170 gibbons has more recently been identified as <em>H. leuconedys</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2006) and should be subtracted from the population estimate if this identity is proven. Moreover, there are surveys needed in Mehao region, where there is uncertainty as to which species the gibbons there represent (Das <em>et al.</em> 2006, Das pers. comm). Namdapha National Park in the Changlang District of Arunachal Pradesh is a relative stronghold for this species in India, offering the population there its largest contiguous stretch of protected habitat (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;Recent surveys by Ray <em>et al.</em> (2015) using auditory methods have revealed high average densities of 3.47 groups per km² in the northern part of Namdapha National Park, which would yield projections of the total population in the park of over 15,000. However, caution is advised, as further surveys in the central and southern parts of the park are needed, and are ongoing.<br/><br/>There are no population estimates available for Myanmar. It is possible that the largest and most viable populations of western hoolock are to be found in this country, where at present almost no attention is paid to it (W. Brockelman pers. comm). There are several thousand square kilometres of unsurveyed forest habitat in the central-west and north-west of this country, with a particular need to survey the western areas west of Chindwin/Ayerawady River. There are reports of gibbons in Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range, but there is no knowledge of the actual population level there (W. Brockelman pers. comm. 2006). The western part of Hukuang Tiger Reserve with a large area of forest (&gt;1,000 km²) has not been surveyed, but is likely to have this species. The northern limit is just south of Hkakaraborazi National Park.",Decreasing,"This species is found in eastern Bangladesh, northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), and northwestern Myanmar (west of the Chindwin River). It might possibly occur in China (extreme southeastern Tibet). The distribution in India is restricted to points south of the Brahmaputra and east of the Dibang (Dingba Qu) Rivers (Choudhury 2001). Animals that once were common in the plains of Arunachal Pradesh (northeasternmost India) before that habitat was cultivated for agriculture and tea are not so any more (Islam and Feeroz 1992).<br/><br/>The boundary between the two species of <em>Hoolock</em> is the Chindwin River, which flows into the Ayerawady (Irrawady) River. At the headwaters in the north there is a hybrid zone or cline between the two species (since they are almost certainly not reproductively isolated). Das <em>et al</em>. (2006) reported the discovery of a population of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em> in Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India, which has traditionally been considered to be part of the range of <em>H. hoolock</em>.",This species is hunted for food throughout most of its range.

The species is restricted in this region to between 2,400 and 4,800 m in elevation, as below this minimum there is only scattered dry scrub or arid rock desert and above this maximum is the alpine zone (Zahler and Woods 1997, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). It is strictly nocturnal, and dietary analysis suggests that it is highly dependent upon pine needles in its diet (Zahler and Khan 2003).&#160;The species nests in the rocky cliffs and the nest looks like a flat bowl and is built with bark, branches and grasses (Oshida <em>et al. </em>2005). Unlike other giant flying squirrels, this species was observed to make glides of just 5-10-20 m long (Dinets 2011).","This species is threatened by habitat loss due to large-scale clear-cutting of forests (Zahler and Woods 1997). It is also threatened to a lesser extent by the expansion of agriculture, small-scale logging, infrastructure development, and human settlements (Molur <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). WCS Pakistan is working with all communities in Diamer on wildlife and forest protection initiatives, but it is not clear yet if these efforts are leading to control of forest loss. Forests of Raikot Valley have been informally protected until 2006 due to the area’s popularity as a tourist destination (Dinets pers. comm. 2015); however, the local tourism industry has all but collapsed and recent satellite images available from Google Earth show dramatic reduction in forest cover (Dinets pers. comm. 2015).&#160;From 1994 to 2016 an annual rate of forest degradation was recorded to be 244.88 ha per annum and deforestation occurring at a rate of 28.61 ha per annum, combined this resulted in a total loss of 34.23% of forest loss (Ahmad <em>et al</em>. 2018).

Estimates in 1996 based on potential available habitat and local knowledge suggest a population in the core region of Diamer of between 1,000 and 3,000 asl (Zahler and Woods 1997). A very brief survey in 2004 failed to locate the species in a number of locations with seemingly good habitat; only two animals were observed (Dinets 2011), but the WCS Pakistan Program, which works largely in Diamer District, continues to find evidence and occasional sightings of the species. There is no current information available on the population abundance of this species elsewhere in South Asia (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>A survey of the Shounthar Valley of district Neelum, Azad Jammu and Kashmir found evidence of the squirrel in 13 caves in the area (Qamar <em>et al</em>. 2012). Dinets (2011), states the previous assessments of continued population reduction caused by an increasingly restricted range remains accurate. Camera trapping surveys in the Upper Bhagirathi Basin, Uttarakhand, India recoded two individuals at two different locations (Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>In the Raikot Valley, one of the few places where the species has been recorded this century, less than 10 km² of tall coniferous forest remain according to recent satellite images available and the actual population might be below 100, although there is no recent data on abundance (V.

Since then, the species has undergone several reintroductions that have presumably reversed its declining trend, but no data are currently available to quantify the effect of these conservation initiatives. Considering the lack of recent data but also the persistence of historical threats, we here adopt a precautionary approach and assume that the total number of mature individuals of Pygmy Hog is still less than 250. Thus, we list this species as Endangered under criterion D.","The Pygmy Hog is the smallest and the rarest wild suid in the world. This species is dependent on early successional riverine communities, typically comprising dense tall grasslands, commonly referred to as 'thatchland', but which, in its pristine state, is intermixed with a wide variety of herbaceous plants and early colonizing shrubs and young trees (Oliver and Deb Roy 1993). There are many species of tall grasses, which dominate in different situations. The most important of these communities for Pygmy Hogs are those which tend to be dominated by <em>Saccharum munja</em>, <em>S. spontaneum</em>, <em>S. bengalensis</em>, <em>Themeda villosa</em>, <em>Narenga porphyrocoma</em> and <em>Imperata cylindrical</em>, which form characteristic associations of 1 to 4 m height, during secondary stages of the succession on well drained ground. These communities are not, therefore, maintained by prolonged inundation, though they may be maintained by periodic burning. However, as they also include some of the most commercially important thatching grasses, some of these areas (including many of those in protected areas) are harvested annually and virtually all of them are subject to wide-scale annual (in some areas, twice-annual) burning. Although it has been suggested by ecologists that any burning be conducted at the beginning of the dry season (in December or early January) in alternate blocks (demarcated by fire-lines) and only once in 2–3 years, most of the grasslands continue to be burnt every year in the dry season, which deleteriously affects their floral and faunal diversity. It has been recognised that some amount of ""early"" burning may be required in order to preclude the possibility of later, uncontrolled 'hot' burns, which are far more destructive, and possibly to delay natural succession of the grasslands in protected areas. However, early burning also may deprive hogs and other grassland dependant species of cover and other resources for a longer period prior to the regrowth of vegetation and has the same consequences of dramatically reducing floral and faunal diversity.","The main threats to survival of Pygmy Hog are loss and degradation of habitat due to human settlements, agricultural encroachments, dry-season burning, livestock grazing, commercial forestry and flood control schemes; the latter as a result of the disruption of natural successions and the replacements of former grasslands by later stage communities or other developments. In Assam, as elsewhere, most former habitat has been lost to settlements and agriculture following the rapid expansion of the human population (Oliver 1980, 1981, 1989; Oliver and Deb Roy 1993). Some management practices, such as planting of trees in the grasslands and indiscriminate use of fire to create openings and to promote fresh growth of grass, have caused extensive damage to the habitats the authorities intend to protect (Narayan and Deka 2002). A combination of these factors has almost certainly resulted in the loss of all of the small populations of these animals in the reserve forests of north-western Assam. These losses strongly reinforced the overwhelming importance of the largest and, by the early to mid-1980s, only known surviving population in the Manas (Oliver 1981, 1989; Oliver and Deb Roy 1993).<br/><br/>Hunting for wild meat by tribes was not considered a major problem in the past but is now threatening the remnant populations (Narayan and Deka 2002). The survival of Pygmy Hogs is closely linked to the existence of the tall, wet grasslands of the region which, besides being a highly threatened habitat itself, is also crucial for survival of a number endangered species such as Indian Rhinoceros (<em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>), Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>), Swamp Deer (<em>Cervus duvauceli</em>), Wild Buffalo (<em>Bubalus arnee</em>), Hispid Hare (<em>Caprolagus hispidus</em>), Bengal Florican (<em>Eupodotis bengalensis</em>), Swamp Francolin (<em>Francolinus gularis</em>) and some rare turtles and terrapins.","Today, this species is on the brink of extinction, as only a few isolated and small subpopulations survive in the wild. In fact, the only viable population of the species, with a few hundred individuals, exists in small grassland pockets of Manas National Park (500 km²) and an adjacent reserve forest in the Manas Tiger Reserve and nowhere else in the world (Narayan and Deka 2002). A 2014 sign survey in Manas indicated that the species was only found in four of the 14 locations surveyed, and there are concerns that the population is still in decline (Ghosh <em>et al.</em> 2014). Initially, sixteen captive-bred Pygmy Hogs were released in Sonai Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary in May 2008 and similar reintroductions have been conducted in Nameri and Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Parks of Assam. By 2016, <em>ca</em> 90 animals had been released at the two latter sites.",Unknown,"In the past, this species was confirmed from only a very few locations in northern West Bengal and northwestern Assam in India, but is believed likely to have occurred in tall, wet alluvial grasslands extending in a narrow belt south of the Himalayan foothills from northwestern Uttar Pradesh and southern Nepal to Assam, possibly extending at intervals into contiguous habitats in southern Bhutan (Oliver 1980, Pradhan 2015). However, it is now confined to a very few locations in and around Manas National Park in north-western Assam (Narayan and Deka 2002, Narayan and Oliver 2015). Releases have increased the wild population of Pygmy Hogs by more than 40%, from &lt;200 wild animals in one subpopulation in 1996 to about 275 in three subpopulations in 2014.",This species is locally hunted for food.,Terrestrial,"The Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme (PHCP) is a broad-based research and conservation programme for this highly threatened species and its equally threatened habitats (Narayan and Deka 2002, Narayan 2006). It is being conducted under the aegis of a formal International Agreement, that was originally signed at New Delhi in 1995 and later renewed as a Memorandum of Understanding in 2001, between IUCN SSC Pigs Peccaries and Hippos Specialist Group, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT), the Forest Department, Government of Assam, and the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. A local governing body consisting of representatives of the four signatories and some Indian experts has been constituted to provide guidance to the Programme. The implementation of this agreement, the first of its kind in India, is being undertaken by PHCP and the local partner organisation, EcoSystems-India, with funds provided by DWCT, with assistance from the European Union, Darwin Initiative (UK government), Assam Valley Wildlife Society, Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations (ZGAP), and various other sources. The primary aim of this collaborative Programme is conservation of the Pygmy Hogs and other threatened species of tall grasslands of the region through field research, captive breeding and re-introduction after adequate restoration of degraded former habitats. One of the main objectives of the Programme was to establish a well structured conservation breeding project for Pygmy Hogs as an insurance against the possible early extinction of the species in the wild and as a source of animals for re-introduction projects. In 1996, six (two male, four female) wild hogs were caught from Manas National Park and transferred to a custom-built research and breeding centre built at Basistha near Guwahati, the capital of Assam. Five more hogs were caught and released at the capture site after fitting three males and a female with radio harness for radio-telemetry studies. The hog population kept in captivity almost doubled in 1997 from 18 to 35 through planned breeding. Between 1998 and 2002, several more hogs were born in captivity and a rescued wild hog was added to the captive population, taking it to over 75 animals which constituted over 1200% increase in six years. Although two more enclosures and a quarantine facility were constructed at Basistha, the unanticipated and rapid increase in the captive population created accommodation problems, forcing the Programme to restrict breeding in captivity. Subsequently, a much larger facility was established at Potasali near Nameri National Park in Assam. This facility includes four holding enclosures and four pre-release enclosures with near natural habitat, where hogs earmarked for reintroduction are reared. Since the animals at Basistha Centre are the only captive Pygmy Hogs in the world, the second centre is also an insurance against any catastrophe at the present location. Once the Potasali pre-release enclosures were ready and the habitat at one of the release sites became reasonably suitable, the hogs were allowed to breed again.<br/><br/>Surveys to locate possible release sites in Assam were carried out, as the rapidly increasing captive population necessitated transfer of some of these pygmy hog back to where they belonged. Two potential re-introduction sites were identified in Sonai Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary and Nameri National Park, both in Sonitpur district of Assam bordering Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh. Habitat management and protection regimes at the potential release sites were assessed in consultation with authorities and recommendations for restoration and scientific management were given. The management authorities are trying to implement the recommendations with limited access. The habitat in a part of Orang National Park was also found suitable, but in absence of any reliable record of the species formerly occurring in this area, further evaluation is considered necessary. <br/><br/>The actual release of hogs was delayed initially due to security problems and later due to presence of factors that were responsible for disappearance of the hogs at the potential reintroduction sites. Once some of the recommendations were implemented at one of the sites (Sonai Rupai), preparations for soft release were started. In 2007, 23 babies were produced at Basistha. Three social groups comprising 16 (seven male, nine female) hogs, including 10 yearlings, were transferred from Basistha to Potasali pre-release enclosures in December 2007. They were kept in the pre-release enclosures under minimum human contact. Each of these enclosures are 2,400 to 3,200 m² in size and capable of meeting most of the food requirements of a group of 5–6 hogs. These hogs began to behave like wild animals within a few weeks and did not come close even to their keepers except in an area where they were offered a few morsels of their favourite food. They were shifted to a release enclosure in Sonai Rupai after five months, and were given access to go to the wild after about two weeks. Unfortunately, the radio telemetry studies on these hogs could not be done as the radio harness fitted on six of them while they were in pre-release caused injuries when they moved rapidly through very dense grass. The released hogs will be monitored through indirect means (droppings, nests) and by observing them at bait stations. <br/><br/>Community conservation initiatives and awareness campaign have been started in the fringe villages of Manas, Nameri and Sonai Rupai as it is almost impossible to save the species without the cooperation of the local population. Capacity building and training programmes are also being carried out for the frontline protection staff in the above protected areas.<br/><br/>This species is listed in CITES Appendix I (as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sus salvanius</span>).",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

The natural process of succession of grassland into woodlands reduces suitable habitat for grassland specialists such as the Hispid Hare. Thus, the elephant grass habitat occupied by the species is highly fragmented, and often intersected by forests, streams, and rivers (Maheswaran 2002). It has been estimated that a decline (quantitative and qualitative) of 20-50% in suitable habitat occurred between 1994 and 2005, a rate that was expected to continue through 2014 (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005). Recent literature indicates that the destruction of habitat has continued (Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup, Dorji and Jamphel 2015). The Hispid Hare is also affected negatively by grazing, predation, loss of grassland habitat due to encroaching broadleaved trees, and thatch collection (Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>","<p>During the mid-1960s there was speculation that the Hispid Hare had gone extinct, however, the capture of a live specimen in 1971 in the Barnadi Wildlife Sanctuary, northwest Assam, confirmed that the species was persisting (Maheswaran 2002). Across its range the species has experienced a dramatic decline due to habitat loss and other contributing factors in recent years, using the early work of Bell (1987), Bell <em>et al.</em> (1990), and Maheswaran (2002) as benchmarks. For example, at Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve Bell (1987) found a density of 6.10/ha, whereas Yadav <em>et al. </em>(2008) determined the density to be 1.01/ha. Working in the same reserve, Aryal<em> et al. </em>(2012) estimated that the entire population size was only 219 (±40) Hispid Hares. The recent discovery of a Hispid Hare in Chitwan National Park was the first sighting of this species there in over three decades (Khadka <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Knowledge of the distribution of the Hispid Hare has always been limited. The historic range of the species extended along the foothill region of the southern Himalayas from Uttar Pradesh through southern Nepal, the northern region of West Bengal to Assam, and into Bangladesh as far south as Dacca (Bell <em>et al.</em> 1990). The current distribution in South Asia is sporadic, including the countries of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Bhutan (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup <em>et al.</em> 2015, Khadka <em>et al.</em> 2017). While its extent of occurrence is estimated to be 188,316 km², this belies its highly fragmented occurrence and highly specialized habitat that is under threat from numerous factors. Recent observations (within the past 10 years) have only been made in Shuklaphanta National Park, Bardia National Park, Chitwan National Park (Nepal), Jaldapara National Park and Manas National Park (India) and Royal Manas National Park (Bhutan) (Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup <em>et al.</em> 2015, Khadka <em>et al.</em> 2017). Within each of these parks only small areas of grassland habitat are suitable for the Hispid Hare, and most surveys are only successful at finding occupancy, in small numbers, in a small percentage of potential habitat. The number of locations where extant Hispid Hare populations have been located in the past 10 years, as evidenced by the recent literature, is significantly less than the number of those identified by Bell <em>et al.</em> (1990). The area of occupancy for the Hispid Hare has been estimated to be &lt;500 km², in highly fragmented populations in widely disparate localities (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005). It occurs at elevations ranging from 100-250 m (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>","<p>This species may be locally harvested, although due to its extremely low density, it is not highly sought after (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The Hispid Hare is listed in CITES Appendix I (although this may be a historical artifact of an early listing; the species is never known to have been involved in trade), in India it is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and in Nepal it is listed in Schedule I of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973 (Bell <em>et al.</em> 1990, Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jnawali <em>et al.</em> 2011). It has been nationally listed in India as Endangered B2ab(ii,iii,iv) due to restricted area of occupancy, few and fragmented locations, with major threats affecting habitat area and quality (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005). In Nepal, it has been nationally listed as Critically Endangered B1ab(ii,iii,iv)+2ab(ii,iii,iv) due to restricted extent of occurrence and area of occupancy, single location with major threats affecting habitat area and quality (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  The Hispid Hare has records of occurring in several protected areas, including Suklaphanta National Park (earlier Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve), Bardia National Park, Chitwan National Park, Dudwa National Park, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, Kahna National Park, and Barnodi Wildlife Sanctuary (Maheswaran 2002, Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2011). A survey conducted in 2001 found no evidence of the presence of the Hispid Hare in Buxa Tiger Reserve, where it had been reported as occurring it the 1980s (Maheswaran 2002). And as indicated above, recent sightings have been confined to a small number of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.<br/> <br/> Long term research is needed to examine effects of threats such as burning, harvesting, and livestock grazing, as well as studies of ecology, reproduction, and movement patterns during flood and burning seasons (Yadav <em>et al. </em>2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan<em> et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup <em>et al.</em> 2015). Control of the burning season within the range of the Hispid Hare is needed to ensure that suitable habitat is available throughout the year, as well as the development of management plans for the remaining areas of suitable grassland habitat. Forest managers should be encouraged in the fostering of local species of grass and avoid the introduction of alien species for use by camp elephants (Maheswaran 2002). A return to the natural system would help prevent the extirpation of Hispid Hares, as well as other native species (Maheswaran 2002). Local education regarding the status of Hispid Hares is necessary, including educating staff of reserves where the species occurs. Forest guards are often only aware of the Indian Hare (<em>Lepus nigricollis</em>) and should be educated in the areas of active preservation of threatened species).",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global
2173,45818198,7140,Elephas maximus,Endangered,A2c,2020,2019-09-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-IN"">The Asian Elephant is listed as Endangered (EN) because of a population size reduction inferred to be at least 50% over the last three generations, based on a reduction in its area of occupancy and the quality of its habitat. As per an assessment in the early 2000s, nearly half of the Asian Elephant’s range, spanning 873,000 km² across 13 countries in the continent, comprised habitats that are fragmented and strongly impacted by anthropogenic pressures (Leimgruber <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Although efforts to map the current range-wide distribution of the species are afoot, evaluations of elephant presence in some range countries suggest a declining trend: elephant distribution is estimated to have reduced by ca. 20% in Sri Lanka between 1960 and now (Fernando <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019); in the Yunan Province of China, it is estimated to be one-third of what it was in 1975 (Liu <em>et al</em>.&#160;2017); in Myanmar, it is estimated to have decreased by 5% between 1992 and 2006 (Songer <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016); and in the southern Western Ghats of India, the estimated decline in elephant distribution is <em>ca</em> 11% in 30 years, between 1979 and 2009 (Pillay <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>While populations of Asian Elephants in South Asia are believed to have been relatively stable in the recent past, numbers have plummeted in Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and Indonesian Sumatra (Menon and Tiwari 2019). In light of growing anthropogenic threats across elephant habitats, population declines are a distinct possibility. However, the lack of reliable population estimates across most of the Asian elephant range presents a considerable challenge to detecting such declines. Nevertheless<span lang=""EN-IN"">, <span lang=""EN-IN"">from what is known about trends in habitat loss/degradation and other threats including poaching, an overall population decline of at least 50% since 1945 over the last three generations (estimated to be 75 years, based on a generation time estimated to be 25 years) seems realistic. The Sumatran subspecies is listed as Critically Endangered (CR).</span></p>","The Asian Elephant is one of the last few mega-herbivores (i.e. plant-eating mammals that reach an adult body weight in excess of 1,000 kg) still extant on earth (Owen-Smith, 1988). Being hindgut fermenters with relatively poor digestive efficiency (Dumonceaux 2006), elephants must consume large quantities of food per day to meet energy requirements. They are generalists and feed on a variety of plants, which vary depending upon the habitat and season. Sukumar (1992) observed that in southern India, the portion of the diet consisting of browse shifted from around 70% in the dry season, to 45% in the wet season. However, in an adjoining area, Baskaran <em>et al.</em> (2010) found that browse formed only 15% of the diet in dry deciduous forest and 47% of the diet in the thorn forest in the dry season, while the annual diet was dominated by grass (84%). Baskaran (2002) also recorded that elephants fed on 82 species of plants (59 woody plant species and 23 grass species). In Sri Lanka, elephants may feed on more than 60 species of plants belonging to 30 families (McKay 1973). On the other hand, elephants appear to preferentially feed on monocots (Campos-Arceiz and Blake 2011), with Bornean elephants especially favoring species of Poaceae (English <em>et al.</em> 2014). Elephants may spend up to 14–19 hrs a day feeding, during which they may consume up to 150 kg of wet weight (Vancuylenberg 1977).<br/><br/>Asian Elephants inhabit grassland, tropical evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous forested and dry thorn forest, in addition to cultivated and secondary forests or scrublands. They are seen from sea level to over 3,000 m asl in the Eastern Himalaya (Choudhury 1999). However, it is unclear which, if any, of these habitat types represent optimal suitable habitat for elephant as many landscapes have been subject to human modification. Elephant densities can range from &gt; 3/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Borneo, to fewer than &lt;1/km<sup>2</sup> in much of mainland Southeast Asia (Alfred&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; de Silva, Ranjeewa and Weerakoon 2011; Fernando and Pastorini 2011; Jathanna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Recorded densities appear lower in heavily forested environments compared to those that are more grass-dominated, but it is difficult to distinguish whether this is due to resource limitations or more recent declines from hunting pressure and overall habitat loss. Elephants can range over large areas and as a consequence, elephants disperse seeds over longer distances than most other herbivores and thus are responsible for structuring and maintaining plant diversity within ecosystems (Campos-Arceiz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008 Campos-Arceiz and Blake 2011). Home range sizes likely depend not only on availability of forage, but also of water, needed for drinking, bathing and wallowing. More recently home ranges are being influenced by the level of disturbance and other development activities (e.g. roads, fences, canals etc.) the elephants are encountering. Asian Elephants especially rely on the evaporation of water from the skin for cooling (Dunkin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).<br/><br/>Given their large area requirements, elephants are regarded as “umbrella species” because their conservation will also protect a large number of other species occupying the same area. They may also be considered “flagship species” because of their iconic or cultural value and “keystone species” because of their important ecological role and impact on the environment.<br/><br/>The lifespan of Asian Elephants is 60 to 70 years, and males reach sexual maturity at between 10–15 years of age; while females are capable of giving birth as early as 11, most do so in the wild between the ages of 13–16 (Shoshani and Eisenberg 1982, de Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Because of the lengthy gestation and parturition periods elephants have a minimum inter-birth-interval of approximately four-five years (Sukumar 2003), but in areas where there is a high density, intervals may extend to six years or more (Sukumar 1992, Williams 2007, de Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Calf survival can be influenced by social buffering, particularly from grandmothers (Lahdenpera <em>et al</em>. 2016), which makes Asian elephants one of the unique social species. Older females tend to have longer birth intervals, thus aging populations may experience negative feedback on population growth. Therefore, even though individual animals may be long-lived, populations are vulnerable to gradual demographic collapse if mortality rates in younger age classes become too high (de Silva and Leimgruber 2019).<br/><br/>Asian Elephant society is organised into well-defined, matrilineal communities or clans comprising adult females, as well as sub-adult and juvenile males and females (de Silva <em>et al</em>. 2011b, Nandini <em>et al</em>. 2018). All the members of the clan do not necessarily associate for extended periods as it is a society with high fission-fusion dynamics, with groups of elephants seen usually being a part of a larger community/clan (de Silva <em>et al</em>. 2011b, Nandini <em>et al</em>. 2018). Subadult males disperse from their natal clans, and adult males (bulls) are primarily solitary but form loose social bonds with other males and only temporarily associate with female groups (Desai and Johnsingh 1995, Vidya and Sukumar&#160;2005). Females or subsets of them within a clan are genetically related to one another (Vidya and Sukumar 2005, Nandini 2016). <br/><br/>Asian Elephants move over long distances in search of food and shelter. Both females and males have well-defined home ranges and show fidelity to their established home ranges (Baskaran&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Baskaran&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Home range sizes in India have been estimated to be between 550 and 700 km² for female clans in tropical deciduous forests of south India (Baskaran <em>et al.</em> 1995) and between 188 and 407 km² for different males and female clans in north India (Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). In Sri Lanka home range sizes have been estimated to be between 34 and 400 km² in a study of males and female groups by Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008) and in another study of two female groups, it was estimated to be 217 and 326 km² (Marasinghe&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). In Sumatra, a study by&#160;Moßbrucker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2016) showed that home range sizes of males and female groups ranged between 210 and 997 km for elephants in Jambi Province. In Borneo, a study by Raymond&#160;<em>et al.</em><sup>²</sup>(2012) showed that home ranges of males and female groups ranged from 291 to 778 km² for three elephants which had reasonable monitoring periods (&gt;200 days). Evans&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2020) however indicated a mean home range of 149.27 (±108.70) km². The linear extent of home ranges can vary from 10 to 150 km or more depending on the size of the home range. This would indicate that transboundary populations can range deep into the different Range States. Overlapping and large home ranges would essentially straddle vast areas across national boundaries. Movement within home ranges has been shown to be influenced by seasonal changes in resources (Fernando 2015, Baskaran&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018) or behavioural changes due to disturbance (Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Those seasonal movements, that are influenced by availability of food, water and climate, are both cyclic and predictable. However, in Rajaji NP in north India, Williams <em>et al</em>. (2008) showed that females with very young calves traded safety for food by choosing habitats with less food, but also less disturbance. Elephants also preferred gentle terrain over steeper slopes when given a choice as shown by Raymond <em>et al</em>. (2012). This indicates that elephants found in very hilly terrain maybe a by product of more productive plains habitat being converted to agriculture. A recent study from the resource-rich, well-protected ecosystem of Kaziranga NP in NE India, suggests that female-led herds move about their activity centres considerably more than adult males (Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In such productive habitats, spatio-temporal &#160;segregation of herds is likely to be favored as it can ease intra-specific competition and allow an ‘ecological release’ from strict matriarchal hierarchies, resulting in fission-fusion social dynamics (de Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011b,&#160;de Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Larger gatherings of elephants tend to occur in South Asia during dry seasons, particularly near large water bodies (de Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011b, Nandini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). This is possibly a more recent phenomenon owing to land-use changes and resource constraints. It is also concurrently possible that movement patterns of adult males are more localized in a given season, but they show larger shifts in activity centres than herds with change in season and associated resource availability (Goswami&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). Musth in males appears to be a roving strategy among older males (Keerthipriya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), which show much larger home ranges in musth than when not in musth (Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>A characteristic strategy of male Asian Elephants is the dispersal of males when they attain puberty (Sukumar 1989, Desai and Johnsingh 1995). Male Asian Elephants have been found to show locational dispersal to a location different from their natal home range, as opposed to social dispersal away from the natal clan but remaining in the same home range (Vidya and Sukumar 2005, Vidya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Ahlering&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). It is possible that such dispersal may help in avoiding inbreeding and is critical for gene flow between different locations.","The challenges confronting elephant conservation in most elephant Range States are habitat loss and fragmentation, human–elephant conflict, and poaching and illegal trade of elephants (Leimgruber <em>et al.</em> 2003; Sukumar 2003, 2006; Sukumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Hedges 2006; Menon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; AERSM 2017). As elephant habitats decrease and get more fragmented, the interaction between humans and elephants increase, leading to intense conflicts between people and elephants, causing fatalities on both sides besides damage to human property (Sukumar 1990, Nath and Sukumar 1998, Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Madhusudan 2003, Kumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). The elephant populations of Vietnam, Sumatra and Myanmar are under great threat; only 100–130 elephants thought to be left in the wild in Vietnam, with the likely numbers even lower. Apart from ivory, the trade of other body parts of elephants, especially skin trade has increased in the last few years further threatening the elephant populations, especially in Myanmar. The trade could result in indiscriminate killing of elephants of both sexes, thereby further endangering the fragile elephant population in the region. The skin is being used to make beads that are worn as bracelets and necklaces sold as good-luck charms. This seems to be a product that is not in traditional Chinese medicine and has been invented in the last few years. However, human–elephant conflict remains the number one cause of mortality for Asian Elephants in the wild and has become a major threat for the conservation of the species across its range of distribution, and needs to be urgently managed to prevent retaliation and wiping out of elephant populations in the wild.<br/><u><br/></u><strong><u>Habitat loss and fragmentation</u></strong><br/>Forests in tropical countries have undergone notable change due to human pressures in the last century that may have resulted in extinction of several species (Myers 1987) and restricted faunal species to islands of forests following fragmentation (Laurance and Bierregaard 1997). Fragmentation of elephant habitats has resulted in reduction of available undisturbed spaces (Leimgruber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003), thereby leading to compression of elephant herds in Protected Areas (PAs), causing escalation of human–elephant conflict in the adjoining human-dominated landscapes (Sukumar 1990, Desai 1991, Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Elephants in Asia inhabit regions that also have large human populations, growing at a rate of 0.5–1.5% per annum (Cincotta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000), and this has associated impacts on elephant habitats through deforestation and various developmental pressures (e.g. Miettinen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). The spread of human settlements, plantations, industry, farming, mining and linear infrastructures (roads, railway lines, irrigation canals, power lines, pipelines) have squeezed extant elephant populations into ever-decreasing pockets of forests and have blocked traditional migratory routes (Santiapillai and Jackson 1990; Leimgruber<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003; Sukumar 1989, 2003, 2006; Hedges 2006; Menon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, 2017). In the context of such drastic natural habitat modifications, the continued existence of Asian Elephants depends on the retention of PAs as core habitats, restoring highly degraded habitats, and establishing and maintaining connectivity between forested habitats (Menon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, 2017; Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014a). The Asian Elephant is a habitat generalist species that occupies natural and human-modified areas, and the ability of the species to adapt their ecology and behaviour in response to anthropogenic change will also determine their persistence in human-dominated landscapes (Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b, Kumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Krishnan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). Across Asia, degradation and increased conversion of forest habitats to agricultural lands and plantations (Jha&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Estes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Gopala&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Abram&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Goossens&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Leimgruber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) has drastically reduced available habitats and compromises its ability to sustain elephant populations in the natural forest habitats (Nyhus&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000;&#160;Sukumar 2003;&#160;Blake and Hedges 2004;&#160;Hedges&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005;&#160;Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014a, 2014b; Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002;&#160;Williams and Johnsingh 2004). Thus, there is a need to expand focus of conservation efforts beyond Protected Areas as a sizeable proportion of Asian Elephant populations exist in human-use landscapes adjoining forest habitats, determining their survival in altered landscapes (Madhusudan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Menon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Even where there is significant, natural habitats left, Madhusudan (2004) and Prasada&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2011) showed that alien invasive species and livestock grazing are now reported to be significant threats to natural food plants across much of the Asian Elephant range.<br/><br/>Linear intrusions such as railway lines, power transmission lines, and highways cutting through elephant habitats also affect the species at large by fragmenting the habitat (Raman 2011). Elephant death on certain stretches of railway tracks has been a serious concern for elephant conservation (Rangarajan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, Menon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Sarma&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In India alone, about 310 elephants have died due to train hits between 1987 and June 2019 of which more than two-thirds of the deaths have been reported from Assam and West Bengal (Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, Menon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Sarma&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). In Sri Lanka, about 14 elephants have died due to train hits in 2018 (till Oct 2018) and seven elephant deaths reported by train hits in 2017. With elephants living in forested habitat islands surrounded by human dominated landscapes, a major challenge is maintaining the long-term viability of elephant populations. A solution lies in the establishment of connectivity between elephant habitats to ensure that there is both space for ranging for these large mammals and to maintain a larger population for longer term viability. Rapid human developmental activities in a quest for higher economic growth in developing countries across Asia has resulted in loss of physical and functional corridors between populations&#160; and is becoming a serious concern for Asian Elephants (Doerr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Sukumar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Menon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160; Johnsingh and Williams (2001) warned about this and also highlighted where there have been success stories in securing the corridors in India and recommended that this is replicated across Asia. A serious attention to protection of existing elephant corridors is the need of the hour for elephant conservation. Given that mitigation of human–elephant conflict can involve the use of various kinds of barriers, there can be a trade-off between the management of conflict and the need to maintain connectivity for the species; it is imperative that mitigation measures do not compromise elephant movement in areas critical for Asian Elephant population connectivity (Goswami and Vasudev 2017).<u><br/><br/></u><strong><u>Human–elephant conflict</u><br/></strong>Human–elephant conflict, a direct result of habitat conversion and fragmentation, now threatens the survival of elephants across range states in Asia. Across Asia, in landscapes where people and elephants share spaces, negative interactions intensify into incidents of conflict, leading to loss of lives on both protagonists, besides causing damages to crops and property (Madhusudan 2003, Kumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Hedges and Gunaryadi 2010, Goswami&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Sukumar <em>et.al.</em> 2016). In Asia, people and elephants are increasingly coming into conflict as elephant habitats are either being converted to cultivated lands and plantations (Sukumar 1989, Santiapillai and Jackson 1990) or modified for construction of dams, power generation stations and mines, and fragmented by roads, canals, powerlines etc. (Johnsingh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1990, Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). High pressures on elephant habitats due to increased human densities, especially in the Western Ghats of India and Sri Lanka, gives an astounding dimension to human–elephant conflict (Cincotta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000). This would further compress elephant populations in their natural habitats and push them into surrounding agriculture crops and human habitations leading to intense human–elephant conflict (Sukumar, 1990, Thouless, 1994, Nyhus&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000). Climate change impacts that lead to variability in rainfall, and thereby resource availability, can increase the proclivity with which elephants raid crops and thus come into conflict with people (Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Decreased threshold levels of human tolerance towards elephants and increased negative interactions have, and can continue to, affect human–elephant coexistence in modified landscapes (Gureja&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b, Calabrese&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Conflicts between people and elephants result in the loss of more than 600 humans and 450 elephant lives every year in Asia; 80-85% of these reported from India and Sri Lanka alone.&#160; It is also known that record of elephant deaths to HEC is not formally recorded outside of South Asia and in a few sites in SE Asia. Therefore the number of elephants dying due to conflict might be an underestimate.<br/><br/>Retaliatory killings of elephants due to conflict are effected through poisoning, electrocution, gun shots, Hakka-patas mostly intentional actions, but sometimes accidental (Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Palei&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In several intense conflict areas, elephants are poisoned intentionally by farmers in defence of crops. Between 1997 and 2016–17, there have been 107 reported poisoning cases of elephants and 879 cases of elephant electrocution across India (MoEFCC). However the retaliatory killing of elephants are probably not reported or recorded from large parts of the Asian Elephant range, especially SE Asia, and thus the magnitude of the problem is poorly understood. Like most other conflict-related deaths, elephant mortalities due to poisoning and electrocution are on the rise owing to intense negative interactions at the human–elephant interface. Increasing trend in retaliatory killing of elephants has been a serious concern for elephant conservation in highly populated countries such as India and Sri Lanka (Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Gubbi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Thus, decreased threshold levels of human tolerance towards elephants and increased negative interactions have affected human–elephant coexistence in modified landscapes (Gureja&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Calabrese&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Fernando&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Human-elephant conflict in many places in South Asia is now a governance issue, especially in sites where humans are being killed as a result, rather than strictly a conservation issue.<br/><u><br/></u><u><strong>Poaching and trade of body parts</strong><br/></u>Poaching is a major threat to elephants in Asia, although reliable estimates of the number of elephants killed and the quantities of ivory and other body parts collected and traded are scarce (Sukumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Milliken, 2005). Although it was traditionally believed that poaching is a relatively minor threat to Asian Elephant because some males and all females lack tusks (Dawson and Blackburn 1991, Sukumar 1989) but in reality Asian Elephants are poached not only for ivory but for a variety of other products (including meat and skin), and poaching is acknowledged as a threat to the long-term survival of some Asian Elephant populations (e.g. Kemf and Santiapillai 2000; Menon 2002; Elephant Family 2018, 2019). The emerging trade of skin for making beads, pendants, powder etc. in Myanmar and parts of Cambodia may severely threaten elephant populations in Southeast Asia which already have low densities of elephants. There has been a significant increase in skin trade across Southeast Asia, with China even providing licenses for sale of pharmaceutical products containing elephant skin, besides its aesthetic/ornamental use (Elephant Family 2018). Estimates show that numbers of elephants poached for skin has drastically increased over the past decade; for instance, in Myanmar, four elephants were poached for skin in 2010, which rose to 61 by 2016 (Lynn 2017; Elephant Family 2018, 2019). In 2016–17, one elephant was being killed per week for the skin trade (WWF Myanmar, pers comm). With better social media connectivity, illegal trade is becoming much more apparent through online platforms. Live trade of elephant calves also pose a threat to their wild populations, especially in Myanmar, from where elephants are traded to Thailand for tourism purposes (Elephant Family 2018). Similarly, capture of elephant calves from the wild and their subsequent live trade, particularly from NE India to other parts of the country, poses an additional threat to wild elephants in source habitats (Rangarajan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).","As of 2018, population size estimates collated across all range countries, suggest a global Asian Elephant abundance of 48,323–51,680 individuals in the wild (Menon and Tiwari 2019). Of these, doubtful estimates, comprising those that are based on interviews and expert opinion rather than population estimation or counts, are thought to account for 4,189–6,999 elephants. The likely estimates for each range country are as follows: Bangladesh 289–437; Bhutan 605–761; Cambodia 400–600; China 300; India 29,964; Indonesia 1,784–1,804; Lao PDR 500–600; Malaysia (Peninsular) 1,223–1,677; Malaysia (Sabah) 2040; Myanmar 2,000–4,000; Nepal 109–145; Sri Lanka 5879; Thailand 3,126–3,341; and Viet Nam 104–132. However, Blake and Hedges (2004) and Hedges (2006) argue that the oft-repeated global population ‘estimate’ of about 40,000 to 50,000 Asian Elephants is no more than a crude guess, which has been accepted unchanged for a quarter of a century. They argue that with few exceptions all we really know about the status of Asian Elephants is the location of some (probably most) populations, with in some cases a crude idea of relative abundance; and for some large parts of the species' range we do not even know where the populations are, or indeed if they are still extant. These differences of opinion are due in part to the difficulty in counting elephants in dense&#160;vegetation in difficult terrain, different survey techniques being used in different places, and a too-widely held belief that population monitoring is unimportant. This highlights the urgent need to adopt more reliable population estimation methods across larger parts of the Asian Elephant range, as is being increasingly recognized (e.g., Rangarajan <em>et al.</em> 2010, Jathanna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Such methods, including capture–recapture and distance sampling, have been successfully applied to Asian Elephant population estimation in some key habitats (e.g., Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, de Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011a, Hedges&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Jathanna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Goswami&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Nevertheless, whatever the error margins, it appears almost certain that over 60% of the remaining wild Asian Elephants occur in India. <br/><br/>The overall population trend of the Asian Elephant has been downwards,&#160;<span class=""msoIns"">as inferred from the reduction in habitat,&#160;probably for centuries. This remains the case in most parts of its range, but especially in most of the countries of South-east Asia (Vietnam, Indonesia, Lao PDR) where habitat loss and fragmentation has resulted in the disappearance of elephants over much of the ranges in the above three places. In Sri Lanka, the population has increased. Within India, it is plausible that a sizeable proportion of the large population in the Western Ghats located in the south of the country, has been stable over the last two decades, likely due to effective conservation efforts. However, elephant population distribution seems to have declined in NE India, mirroring more the SE Asian situation of declines.",Decreasing,"Asian Elephants formerly ranged from West Asia along the Iranian coast into the Indian subcontinent, eastwards into South-east Asia including Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, and into China at least as far as the Yangtze-Kiang. This former range covered over 9 million km² (Sukumar 2003). Asian Elephants are now extinct in West Asia, Java, and most of China. The western populations (<em>Elephas maximus asurus</em>) were probably extinct by 100 BC, and the main Chinese populations (sometimes referred to as <em>E. m. rubridens</em>) disappeared sometime after the 14th century BC. Even within its surviving range in South and South-east Asia, the species has been in retreat for hundreds if not thousands of years, and generally survives only in highly fragmented populations (Olivier 1978, Sukumar 2003, Blake and Hedges 2004).<br/><br/>Asian Elephants still occur in isolated populations in 13 range states, with a very approximate total range area of 486,800 km² (Sukumar 2003, but see Blake and Hedges 2004; note that this range area is a different parameter than the extent of occurrence calculation used for Red List assessments). The species occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in South Asia and Cambodia, China, Indonesia (Kalimantan and Sumatra) Lao PDR, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam in South-east Asia. Feral populations occur on some of the Andaman Islands (India).<br/><br/>The elephants of Borneo were believed to be feral descendants of elephants introduced in the 14<sup>th</sup>–19<sup>th</sup> centuries (Shoshani and Eisenberg 1982, Cranbrook <em>et al</em>. 2008); however, recent genetic evidence suggests they are indigenous to the island (Fernando <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sharma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/><br/>The species was once found throughout Sri Lanka, but today elephants are restricted mostly to the lowlands in the dry zone where they are still fairly widespread in north, south, east, north-western, north-central and south-eastern Sri Lanka; with the exceptions of small remnant populations in the Peak Wilderness Area and Sinharaja Area, elephants are absent from the wet zone of the country. The species continues to lose range to development activities throughout the island. <br/><br/>Once widespread in India, the species is now restricted to four general areas: northeastern India, central India, northwestern India, and southern India. In northeastern India, the elephant range extends from the eastern border of Nepal in northern West Bengal through western Assam along the Himalaya foothills as far as the Mishmi Hills in Arunachal Pradesh. From here it extends into eastern Arunachal Pradesh, the plains of upper Assam, and the foothills of Nagaland. Moving westwards from there, the elephant range spans parts of the lower Brahmaputra plains and the Karbi Plateau to extend into the Garo Hills of Meghalaya through the Khasi Hills. Elsewhere in the south in Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, and the Barak valley districts of Assam, isolated herds have known to occur (Choudhury 1999). In central India, highly fragmented elephant populations are found in the states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and the southern part of West Bengal. Elephants have now started migrating to neighbouring Madhya Pradesh from Chhattisgarh. In north-western India, the species occurs in six fragmented populations at the foot of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, ranging from Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Bahraich Forest Division in the east, to the Yamuna River in the west. The elephants in southern India range over forested hilly tracts of the Western Ghats and the adjacent Eastern Ghats in the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and, more recently, in small areas of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Goa. Their distribution has shrunk within the Ghats owing to increase in human population and resultant development activities and agriculture. At present, elephants are found in five major landscapes in southern India: Uttara Kannada and crestline of the Western Ghats, mainly in the forests of Dandeli that includes a few elephants that move into Maharashtra and Goa; the Malnad plateau, in particular the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, to the east of the Western Ghats; the Brahmagiri–Nilgiri–Wyanad–Mysore landscape, with the Nagarahole, Bandipur, Wyanad and Mudumalai complex of reserves harbouring one of the highest elephant densities, followed by significant numbers in the Biligirirangans and the hilly tract along the Cauvery river of the Eastern Ghats, a small population of elephants that dispersed from here in the 1980s now ranges as scattered groups over isolated hills to the east in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu; Anamalai–Nelliyampathy–High Ranges landscape with Anamalai, Parambikulam, Malayattur and Vazahchal Forest Divisions that includes small isolated elephants in Idukki Sanctuary and Kothamangalam Forest Division; Periyar–Agasthyamalai landscape with Periyar, Ranni, and Srivilliputhur as the most important elephant habitats including elephants isolated to the south of Shencottah pass in the Agasthyamalai hills (Baskaran<em> et. al.</em>&#160;2011, Baskaran 2013, Madhusudan <em>et. al.&#160;</em>2015).In Nepal, elephants were once widespread in the lowland Terai, but are now restricted to a few protected areas along the border with India: Royal Chitwan National Park, Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Royal Bardia National Park, and Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, and their environs. There is some movement of animals between these protected areas and between Bardia National Park and the adjacent parts of India.&#160;Wild elephants in Nepal occur in four isolated populations – eastern population in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve and Jhapa district; central population in Chitwan National Park and Parsa National Park; western population in Bardia National Park and adjoining municipalities; and far-western population in Suklaphanta National Park and adjoining municipalities (Pradhan <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2011). The north Bengal population of elephants in northeastern India range quite some distance into eastern Nepal but is now hindered due to fencing along the Mechi river.In Bhutan, all the existing elephant populations are found along the southern belt of Bhutan along the border with India. They are reported from Samtse, Chhukha, Dagana, Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, Royal Manas National Park, Sarang, Samdrupjongkhar and Jomotshangkha Wildlife Sanctuary (NCD 2018, 2019). In the past, elephants made seasonal migrations from Bhutan to the grasslands of India during the wetter summer months of May to October, returning to their winter range in Bhutan from November. Now these movements are restricted as a result of loss of habitat on the Indian side and fragmentation of habitat on the Bhutan side.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, the species was once widespread, but today it is largely restricted to areas that are relatively less accessible to humans, mainly Chittagong and the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Cox Bazar. In addition, some animals periodically visit the New Samanbag area of Maulvi Bazar District under the Sylhet Forest Division in the north-east of the country, coming from the neighbouring Indian states of Tripura, Meghalaya, and Assam (Ministry of Environment and Forest 2018). The elephant habitat in Cox Bazar has been severely impacted by the rehabilitation of Rohingya refugees from Rakhaine area of Myanmar in the last few years.&#160;<br/>The Asian Elephant has a wide, but highly fragmented, distribution in Myanmar. The largest elephant ranges (those supporting &gt;100 individuals) are in the Northern Forest Complex, Sagaing Division (Homalin and Phaungpyin Townships), Rakhine State (Mayyu, Gwa, Thaboung, Pathein and Naguputaw Townships), Bago Yoma, and Tanintharyi Division (Lenya-Mandaing-Manolon area)&#160;<span class=""msoIns"">(<span class=""msoIns"">Leimgruber <em>et al.</em> 2011, MECAP 2018).&#160;In Thailand, the species is distributed in 69 Protected Areas and occurs mainly in the mountains along the border with Myanmar, with smaller fragmented populations occurring in the peninsula in the south (in several forest complexes, south to the border with Malaysia); in the northeast (in the Dong Phaya Yen-Khao Yai forest complex, including Khao Yai National Park, and the Phu Khieo-Nam Nao forest complex); and in the east (in a forest complex composing the Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Soi Dao Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Khitchakut National Park, and Khao Cha Mao National Park).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, elephants are primarily found in the mountains of the south-west and in Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri provinces&#160;(Pollard <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Gray <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014,&#160;<span class=""msoIns"">Maltby and Bourchier 2011<span class=""msoIns"">). Recent surveys in Keo Sema District (Mondulkiri Province) suggest that important numbers may remain in that area (WCS unpubl. data). Elsewhere, Asian Elephants persist in Cambodia in only small, scattered populations (Duckworth and Hedges 1998).In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, elephants remain widely but very patchily distributed in very small numbers in forested areas, both in the highlands and lowlands. Two important and likely viable populations are known, one in Xaygnabouly Province west of the Mekong in Nam Pouy NP and one on the Nakai Plateau, where prime elephant habitat has now been submerged under the Nakai Nam Theun Dam. Other potentially important elephant populations occur in Phou Phanang and Phou Khao Khoay in Vientiane Province; Phou Xang He in Savannakhet Province; Dong Ampham and Dong Khanthung, including Xe Pian, close to Cambodian border; and Nam Et, Nam Xam, Phou Dendin, and Nam Ha in the north, close to the Viet Namese and Chinese borders&#160;<span class=""msoIns"">(<span class=""msoIns"">Khounboline 2011).<span lang=""EN-IN"">In Vietnam, only a small population persists now. <span lang=""EN-IN"">Elephants are currently distributed in three main regions, namely the Nghe An and adjoining areas (Son La and Ha Tinh ) in northern Vietnam, Quang Nam area in central Vietnam and Dak Lak Province and adjoining areas (Dak Nong, Dong Nai and Binh Phuroc ) in southern Vietnam (Figure 1). Within each region, the population is further fragmented into several isolated small groups of elephants (Varma<em> et al. </em>2007, Vidya <em>et al. </em>2007, Thi Ly 2011). These elephant populations remain highly threatened.In China, Asian Elephants once ranged widely over much of southern China, including the Fujiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces (Smith and MacKinnon 2008). The species was extirpated in southern Fujiang and northern Guangdong during the 12th century, but evidence indicates persistence in Guanxi into the 17th century (Smith and MacKinnon, in press). All that now remains of this once widespread elephant population in China is the remnant in Yunnan where the species survives in three administrative units: Xishuangbanna, Simao, and Lincang&#160;(Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2015).<span lang=""EN-IN"">In Peninsular Malaysia, the species is still widely distributed in the interior of the country in the following States: Pahang (which probably has the largest population), Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Negeri Sembilan (where very few animals <span lang=""EN-IN""><span class=""msoIns"">remains). Taman Negara National Park has the largest elephant population (<span lang=""EN-IN""><span class=""msoIns"">Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia 2013).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">On Borneo, elephants only occur in the lowlands of the northeastern part of the island in the Malaysian State of Sabah and adjacent parts of Kalimantan (Indonesia). In Sabah, they occur in forested areas in the south, centre, and east of the State in the following Districts: Kinabatangan, Sandakan, Beluran, Lahad Datu, Tawau, and Pensiangan. In Kalimantan, elephants occur only in the Upper Sembakung River in Tindung District. <span lang=""EN-US"">The five managed elephant Ranges in Sabah include: Lower Kinabatangan, North Kinabatangan (<span lang=""EN-IN"">Deramakot, Tangkulap, Segaliud Lokan)<span lang=""EN-US"">, Central Sabah (<span lang=""EN-IN"">Ulu Segama, Danum Valley, Gunung Rara and Kalabakan)<span lang=""EN-US"">, Tabin and Ulu Kalumpang </span><span lang=""EN-IN"">&#160;(<span lang=""EN-IN"">Sabah Wildlife Department 2011, Alfred <em>et al. </em>2011).In Sumatra (Indonesia), the elephant was once widespread, but now survives only in highly fragmented populations. In the mid-1980s, 44 discrete elephant populations (numbering in total about 2800 to 4800 elephants) were known to exist in Sumatra’s eight provinces scattered from Aceh in the north to Lampung in the south (Blouch and Haryanto 1984, Blouch and Simbolon 1985). However, by 2003, only three of Lampung’s 12 populations were extant (Hedges<em> et al.</em>&#160;2005). A 2009 survey of nine forest blocks in Riau that had counted elephant herds only two years earlier revealed that six herds had gone extinct (Desai and Samsuardi 2009). Over 69% of potential Sumatran elephant habitat has been lost within just one generation (the last 25 years), and much of the remaining forest cover is in blocks smaller than 250 km<sup>2</sup>, which are too small to contain viable elephant populations (Gopala<em> et al.</em>&#160;2011). Nevertheless, the island is thought to hold some of the most significant populations outside of India. For example, in Lampung Province’s two national parks, Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas, produced population estimates of 498 (95% CI=[373, 666]) and 180 (95% CI=[144, 225]) elephants, respectively were obtained (Hedges <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Bukit Barisan Selatan NP is, therefore, a critically important area for Asian Elephant conservation. The challenge now is to protect these populations from further habitat loss and poaching.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The Asian Elephant is hunted for ivory, food, skin, leather and other products. Live animals are also removed from the wild and used in forestry operations and for ceremonial purposes. Very few tuskers are left in the wild in Asia barring a few sites in S. Asia, Sumatra and Borneo and poaching could further threaten the tusker numbers. However, in Myanmar, elephants are now being hunted for their skin. Dried elephant skin is being made into beads for good-luck bracelets and necklaces, dry skin powder mixed with herbs is also used as alleged treatments for dry skin and stomach ailments&#160;(Elephant Family 2018, 2019).",Terrestrial,"The key conservation priorities for the Asian Elephant are:<ol><li>conservation of the elephant's habitat and maintaining habitat connectivity by securing corridors;</li><li>the management of human-elephant conflict as part of an integrated, landscape-scale land-use policy;</li><li>better protection to the species through improved legislation and law enforcement, improved and enhanced field patrolling, and regulating/curbing trade in ivory, live elephants and other elephant products.&#160;</li></ol>Monitoring of conservation interventions is also needed to assess the success or failure of the interventions so that adjustments can be made as necessary (i.e. adaptive management).

The proportion of leaves and tender shoots in the diet is highest in spring and summer, buds and flowers in late summer, and leaves, twigs and flowers of forbs and shrubs later in the year (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011, Syed and Ilyas 2012).<br/><br/>Its main predators include yellow-throated marten, fox, wolf, and lynx. Snow leopard reportedly preys on the species in Nepal (Aryal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) It is generally solitary and crepuscular (Harris and Cai 1993). Population density varies from 3.9 /km² in more arid habitats to 71 /km² in areas with higher rainfall. Densities are lower in areas with heavy snow cover and where there are more competitors (goral, serow and domestic cattle).<br/><br/>Breeding occurs primarily in November-December, with the resulting offspring being born from May to June. After birth, young deer lie hidden in secluded areas, essentially independent of their mothers except at feeding times. This hiding period may last up to 2 months. Gestation is variously reported at from 150-195 days (Hayssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993) and give birth to one offspring (twins are sometimes reported by documentation is lacking). Fawns wean at 3-4 months, are sexually mature at 16-24 months. <br/><br/>Alpine musk deer is sedentary, tending to remain within defined home ranges. In females these are about 125 acres in size, while males will control a territory that encompasses the ranges of several females, possibly defending it against other males. The species is not known to migrate. Communication between individuals is thought to be based primarily on their sense of smell, due to the high development of the glands of musk deer. It is primarily silent, musk deer will emit a loud double hiss if alarmed.","The musk produced by this genus of primitive deer is highly valued for its cosmetic and alleged pharmaceutical properties, and can fetch U.S. $45,000 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) on the international market. Although this musk, produced in a gland of the males, can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac, which yields only about 25 grams (1/40 of a kilogram) of the brown waxy substance. Such poaching is relatively easy to accomplish and difficult to stop using only legal means (Harris 1991, 2007). In Nepal, the increased price of musk deer on the international market has reportedly led to an increase in poaching and trade in the Himalayas (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2010). Poaching and trade of the species for musk is described as ""unabated"" and the principle threat in Uttarakhand, India (Ilyas 2014).<br/><br/>Musk deer also appear to require dense vegetation, either in the form of intact forests or shrublands, thus excessive forest clearing or grazing can preclude musk deer from using such lands (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003). Furthermore, grazing of livestock within protected areas may pose a threat to musk deer through both competition and through disease transmission (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2010).","Estimating population sizes or trends for musk deer is very difficult, and has rarely been done satisfactorily. Population estimates over large-scale areas are subject to considerable uncertainty (and this is exacerbated by uncertainty over taxonomy). A widely repeated but poorly documented estimate is that there were 180,000 individuals in the 1960s and 1970s (Yang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Zhou <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004), but Sheng (1998) reported no more than 100,000 within China in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Liu and Sheng (2002) estimated population sizes in three Chinese nature reserves in the mid 1990s using extrapolations from counts of pellet groups, but provided few details. They estimated 183227 in the Helan Mountain Nature Reserve in Ningxia, 131-160 in the Shoulu Mountain Nature Reserve in Gansu, and 4,717-5,798 in the Xinglong Mountain Nature Reserve in Gansu. More recent reports suggest that the species has become very rare in the Helan Mountains (Liu, Z.S., East China Normal University pers. comm., 2006) and has been severely depleted since in northwest Yunnan as a result of overexploitation. Snaring has become one of the main threats to the species in northwest Yunnan (Xueyou and Xuelong 2014).<br/><br/>Anecdotal evidence points to a continued decline in abundance within China. Although population estimates contained in Yang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2003) are unreliable, data on musk purchased by local Traditional Chinese Medicine companies probably reflect real trends, and these suggested dramatic declines in musk deer populations during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, Tibet, and Shaanxi. <br/><br/>In Nepal, within protected areas the numbers of the species is reportedly increasing (Aryal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). There is an estimated 600-800 animals in Sagarmatha National Park at densities of up to 45/km², more than 1000 in Shey-Phoksundo National Park, an estimated 500 animals in Langtang National Park, and it also occurs in Annapurna Conservation Area, Kanchanjunga Conservation Area, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve Khaptad National Park and Makulu-Barun National Park.

Populations are still declining in most areas due to several main threats which include depletion of prey base, habitat loss, persecution due to livestock predation, disease transmission from domestic dogs, and possibly interspecific competition. Although there is uncertainty in our estimation, we calculate a total population of 4,500-10,500 individuals, of which only 949-2,215 are mature individuals. Most if not all current subpopulations of Dholes are relatively small and isolated, and often exhibit severe fluctuations in numbers. One of the largest remaining subpopulations of dholes was estimated to contain 207-304 individuals, of which only 44-64 were mature individuals. Therefore, Dholes warrant listing as Endangered under criterion C2a(i).","The Dhole is a habitat generalist, and can occur in a wide variety of vegetation types, including: primary, secondary and degraded forms of tropical dry and moist deciduous forests; evergreen and semi-evergreen forests; temperate deciduous forests; boreal forests; dry thorn forests; grassland–scrub–forest mosaics; temperate steppe; and alpine steppe. Consequently, their elevation range is from sea level to as high as 5,300 m asl in Ladakh (R. Simpson pers. comm.). They have not been recorded in desert regions.<br/><br/>The Dhole is one of only three canid species with specialized dental adaptations for an exclusively carnivorous diet, termed hypercarnivory (Van Valkenburgh 1991). Although Dholes consume a wide variety of prey species, ranging from small rodents and hares to Gaur (<em>Bos gaurus</em>; Karanth and Sunquist 1995, Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ramesh <em>et al</em>. 2012, Selvan <em>et al</em>. 2013a), the preferred prey are ungulates with a body mass of 40-60 kg (Selvan <em>et al</em>. 2013b). However, if this prey size is not available, Dholes will selectively prey upon both smaller and larger ungulate species (Kamler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Seasonal changes occur in the Dhole diets, reflecting seasonal changes in availability and numbers of prey (Thinley <em>et al</em>. 2011). In India, Dholes form relatively large packs (usually five to 10, but up to 25 adults) to efficiently hunt large numbers of prey, as well as to protect litters, which are usually large (usually five to 10, but up to 12 pups; Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, in tropical evergreen forests of Southeast Asia, Dholes appear to persist in smaller packs and presumably have smaller litters, probably due the low prey biomass and small size of ungulate prey in these habitats (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2008).<br/><br/>Due to the demands imposed by hypercarnivory, sufficient numbers of ungulate prey are the Dhole’s major habitat requirements. In India, tropical dry and moist deciduous forest may represent optimal habitats, based on the areas thought to hold the largest Dhole populations. Ungulate biomass, particularly that of cervid species, is highest in these habitat types when compared to other habitats in the same region (A. Venkataraman and V.N. Babu unpubl.). Besides prey numbers, other important factors that may influence habitat use include levels of human disturbance, water availability, tiger presence, and suitability of breeding sites (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2013, Srivathsa <em>et al</em>. 2014, J.F. Kamler unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Dholes reportedly ranged from 23-199 km<sup>2</sup> in India (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Karanth and Sunquist 2000, Acharya 2007) and from 60-80 km<sup>2</sup> in Thailand (Grassman <em>et al</em>. 2005, K. Jenks unpubl. data).","<strong>Depletion of prey base</strong>: This may be the single greatest factor that contributed to the range collapse of Dholes in the northern half of their former distribution, and might be the primary factor for the continued decline of Dholes in the southern half of their distribution. Throughout Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and southeastern China, ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). All ungulate species, except perhaps Muntjac (<em>Muntiacus</em> spp.) and Wild Pig (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), are ecologically or fully extinct across extensive parts of the region (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). This situation will likely hinder any possibility of recovery by the region's Dhole populations, even if the other issues could be addressed. Dholes can probably persist as fragmented populations in large protected areas of Bhutan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Indonesia (Sumatra and Java) and Thailand, as long as prey numbers remain sufficient and other threats are controlled. In large protected areas in southern and central India, Dhole numbers are stable where prey densities are high. In northeastern India, prey depletion is contributing to the decline of Dholes in the region (Gopi <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Habitat loss and transformation</strong>: Habitat loss and degradation are serious threats to Dholes in southern Asia, particularly because this threat is closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. Although extensive areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation remain in Lao PDR and Cambodia, habitat conversion and fragmentation are proceeding unabated. In Viet Nam, very few natural areas greater than 50 km<sup>2</sup> remain. Habitat loss and fragmentation is a major threat to protected areas in Indonesia, particularly those on Sumatra. Habitat loss is driven by several different factors, including logging, palm and rubber plantations, agriculture expansion, rural biomass extraction, livestock grazing and major infrastructure expansion (e.g., hydropower dams, irrigation projects, new highways, etc.).<br/><br/><strong>Persecution</strong>: Persecution of Dholes stems mainly from retaliatory killings due to livestock predation, and this factor is driving some Dhole populations towards local extinction (Lyngdoh <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dholes appear to be especially susceptible to poisoning of carcasses using strychnine or other rodenticides, which often are readily available to rural people in southern Asia. Consequently, unsystematic but consistent poisoning of carcasses can easily wipe out Dholes within an area, especially because the entire pack will feed on a carcass. For example, poisoning of livestock carcasses apparently wiped out Dholes from Bhutan in the 1970s and early 1980s, although this species began to re-occupy the country starting in the 1990s (Wangchuk 2004, Thinley <em>et al</em>. 2011). Killing of Dholes by poisoning livestock carcasses also has been reported in China, Nepal, India and Indonesia, and is likely is widespread in southern Asia. Poisoning campaigns also were thought to have contributed to the extirpation of Dholes in the countries of the former Soviet Union (Ginsberg and Macdonald 1990).&#160;<br/><br/>Dholes reportedly have been shot by humans, as Dhole carcasses with gun-shot wounds were found near the boundary of protected areas in Thailand (K. Jenks and N. Songsasen unpubl.). Dholes are probably susceptible to non-selective snaring, particularly where this activity is widespread such as in Viet Nam, Cambodia, China and Lao PDR. In India, and possibly elsewhere, Dholes living outside or on the edge of core protected areas are particularly vulnerable to human kleptoparasitism.<br/><br/><strong>Disease and pathogens</strong>: Dholes are susceptible to rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus and sarcoptic mange among others (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004), which are usually contracted from domestic village dogs that act as reservoirs. Dholes appear to be especially susceptible to disease epizootics due their large pack sizes and high levels of amicable behaviour within packs, even among adults (Johnsingh 1982). Such behaviours likely result in relatively high intraspecific contact rates, which are conducive for disease epizootics, at least compared to other wild canids such as jackals (<em>Canis aureus</em>) which are more solitary. Disease epizootics may contribute to the sudden disappearance of Dholes from protected areas, and often cause severe local population fluctuations resulting in relatively small pack sizes (Karanth and Sunquist 2000, J. Kamler pers. obs.). In Cambodia, a recent outbreak of canine distemper in 2011-2012, thought to have originated in local domestic dogs, caused the near-extirpation of Dholes from protected areas in the eastern and northern parts of the country (J. Kamler unpubl.), although populations appear to be recovering; mortalities associated with canine distemper also have been observed in a protected area in Thailand (N. Songsasen and K. Jenks unpubl).&#160;The range-wide effects of diseases on Dhole population dynamics is unknown, but it is likely significant across southern Asia, and might result in an increased probability of extirpation for Dhole populations in isolated protected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Competition with other species</strong>: Aside from humans, the main competitors of Dholes for limited resources are Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and Leopards (<em>P. pardus</em>). Although Dholes are much smaller in body size, packs of Dholes reportedly have killed both Tigers and Leopards, although the reverse also has been reported (Burton 1940). The dominance hierarchy between Dholes and Tigers is not clear, although Dholes likely avoid tigers especially if packs are small. Dholes appear to be behaviourally dominant over Leopards, and packs of Dholes often tree this species when they interact (Venkataraman 1995). Whether large felids can negatively affect Dhole numbers is unknown, although the exploitive and interference competition between them likely becomes more intense as prey populations are reduced by humans, possibly resulting in spatial exclusion where prey numbers are lowest. Free-ranging dogs also may compete with Dholes for limited food resources where prey numbers are low.","<strong>Background</strong><strong><br/></strong>Because so little is known about Dhole ecology, we used African Wild Dogs (<em>Lycaon pictus</em>) as a surrogate species for estimating the proportion of mature individuals and generation length. Of the canids, African Wild Dogs are arguably most similar to Dholes. Both species have specialized dental morphology for obligate hypercarnivory (Van Valkenburgh 1991), which is rather unique among canids. Phylogenetic research shows both species are in the same monophyletic group (Lindblad-Toh <em>et al</em>. 2005), and otherwise both species are similar in body size, reproduction, social behaviour and feeding behaviour (Johnsingh 1982). Consequently, much of the text below comes directly from the IUCN assessment for the African Wild Dog (Woodroffe and Sillero-Zubiri 2012).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the number of “mature individuals” is challenging for Dholes, because like African Wild Dogs, they are obligate cooperative breeders (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman 1998). Consequently, within a pack the alpha male and female are the parents of the majority of surviving pups (Venkataraman 1998). Although the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012) define mature individuals as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction”, it does not specify the time period within which reproduction is considered possible. The User Guidelines (IUCN 2014) go on to state “in many taxa there is a pool of non-reproductive (e.g., suppressed) individuals that will quickly become reproductive if a mature individual dies. These individuals can be considered to be capable of reproduction”. As with African Wild Dogs, a high proportion of individual Dholes within a park are indeed reproductively suppressed (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman 1998), but these animals do not necessarily become reproductive “quickly” if an alpha individual dies. In a mature pack, most pack members are offspring of the alpha pair; for these animals, death of an alpha would usually not open up a breeding opportunity because no unrelated mates would be available within the pack. Given these complexities, and in keeping with the spirit of capturing a “snapshot” of current conditions, we have chosen to define mature individuals as those considered capable of reproduction within the current breeding season. The number of mature individuals thus comprises the number of alpha males and females, and the number of sub-dominant (i.e. non-alpha) animals that breed successfully.<br/><br/>Following that reported for Africa Wild Dogs (Woodroffe and Sillero-Zubiri 2012), we estimated for Dholes the number of mature individuals (Nm) from populations of adults and yearlings (Nc). The number of alpha males (NaM) and alpha females (NaF) would be estimated with the following equations:<br/><br/>NaM = Nc x 0.55 x 0.176NaF = Nc x 0.45 x 0.215<br/><br/>The above equations result in approximately equal estimates of the numbers of alpha males and alpha females. Also following that reported for African Wild Dogs (Woodroffe and Sillero-Zubiri 2012), we estimated for Dholes the number of sub-dominant breeders (Nsub) as:<br/><br/>Nsub = (NaM x 0.10) + (NaF x 0.08)<br/><br/>Therefore, the number of mature individuals (Nm) for Dholes could be calculated using the following equation:<br/><br/>Nm = NaM + NaF + Nsub<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Population size and densities</strong><br/>Population estimates of Dholes are not available for any country. Therefore, we made an attempt to estimate the total population of Dholes by classifying countries within their current distribution as having high (1,500-3,000), medium (750-1,500), or low (250-750) numbers of Dholes. These classifications were based on estimates of relative abundances and area covered by Dholes within each country. We classified one country as having high numbers of Dholes (India), two countries with medium numbers (Thailand, Myanmar), six countries with low numbers (Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Nepal), and four countries with negligible numbers (Bangladesh, Korea DPR, Pakistan, Viet Nam). Consequently, we estimate the total population of Dholes to be 4,500–10,500. Although there is relatively high uncertainty with this population estimate, it has a large range and we feel that it adequately represents the possible population size of Dholes.<br/><br/>To calculate total population of mature individuals, we used the equations above to show an estimate of 436-1,016 alpha males (NaM), 435-1016 alpha females (NaF), and 78-183 sub-dominant breeders (Nsub). This resulted in an estimate of 949-2,215 mature individuals (Nm), which is below the 2,500 threshold (i.e., one of the criteria for listing as EN under C).<br/><br/>The only estimates of local Dhole densities come from a few protected areas in India. Only one of those estimates has been obtained through systematic sample-based survey methods (Selvan <em>et al</em>. 2014), whereas the others are presumably based on estimates of the number of packs within the protected areas (derived using known home range areas and knowledge of mean pack sizes). Reported Dhole densities were 0.066 Dholes/km<sup>2</sup> in Pakke Tiger Reserve (Selvan <em>et al</em>. 2014), 0.095 Dholes/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, 0.13 Dholes/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Bandipur Tiger Reserve, and 0.3 Dholes/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Pench National Park (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The size of subpopulations of Dholes has not been reported anywhere. Therefore, the following is our estimate of the size of one of the largest subpopulations of Dholes, which is presumed to be in the Western Ghats of India, based on high prey numbers and extent of protected forests in the region. This region contains the most intensively studied subpopulation of Dholes in the world (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Karanth and Sunquist 1995, Venkataraman 1998, Karanth and Sunquist 2000, Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ramesh <em>et al</em>. 2012, Srivathsa <em>et al</em>. 2014). Srivathsa <em>et al</em>. (2014) estimated the proportion of area occupied by Dholes in the Malenad landscape (Western Ghats in the State of Karnataka), by assessing ""true occupancy"" in 206 grid-cells (188&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;each). This area covers 16 wildlife reserves, where the highest numbers of Dholes are likely restricted to four source populations: Anshi-Dandeli, Bhadra, Nagarahole-Bandipur and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) reserves. Abundance was derived from estimates of occupancy, based on the Royle-Nichols (2003) occupancy model [abundance in a grid-cell= Log (1/(1-PSI))] for all the 206 grid-cells. We calculated a range of abundances for each source population, which likely represent one metapopulation. The lower limit of this range is the sum of grid-cell-wise abundances from those cells that intersect with the reserve boundaries; the upper limit of this range is the sum of grid-cell-wise abundances for the reserve+the cells that are first order neighbours for the reserve cells (with contiguous forest habitats). The following are the abundance ranges for the four source populations: Anshi-Dandeli = 15-46; Bhadra = 23-39; Nagarahole-Bandipur = 85-91, BRT = 24-28. We estimate the remaining forested landscape may support 60-100 Dholes, resulting in a total population of 207-304 individuals. To calculate total number of mature individuals in this subpopulation, we used the above equations which resulted in an estimate of 44-64 mature individuals (20-29 alpha males, 20-29 alpha females, four to six sub-dominant breeders). Clearly, even one of the largest subpopulations of Dholes contains well below 250 mature individuals (i.e., the criterion for listing as EN under C2a(i)).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Change in population size</strong><br/>There is almost no quantitative information on Dhole population trends through their distribution. In fact, a common characteristic of Dhole populations is that they often exhibit severe local population fluctuations (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman 1998, Karanth and Sunquist 2000, Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004, J. Kamler pers. obs.), which makes estimating populations and population trends difficult. We estimate that the total population of Dholes is still decreasing, due to the continuous decline in their distribution.",Decreasing,"Historically, Dholes occurred throughout South and East Asia, to as far north as the southern parts of the Russian Federation (including the Amur region and upper Lena River north of Lake Baikal), and as far west as the mountains ranging from eastern Kazakhstan to northern Pakistan (Altai, Tian Shan, Pamir and western Himalayan mountains; Heptner and Naumov 1967). Dholes have disappeared from &gt;75% of their historic range, and most remaining populations are fragmented and still appear to be declining based on scattered surveys and personal observations. Their current distribution, based on recent information we consider reliable, is described below.<br/><br/><strong>Central and East Asia</strong>: there have been no confirmed reports of Dholes in more than 30 years from the Russian Federation, Mongolia, Kazakhstan (formerly in the Altai and Tian Shan mountains), Kyrgyzstan (formerly in the Tian Shan and Pamir mountains), Afghanistan (formerly in Pamir Mountains), Tajikistan (formerly in Pamir Mountains) or Uzbekistan (formerly in Tian Shan Mountains), and they are likely extirpated from these regions (A. Poyarkov and N. Ovsyanikov in litt., D. Miquelle pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Bangladesh</strong>: Dholes still occur in some forest reserves in the Sylhet area in northeastern Bangladesh, as well the Chittagong Hill Tracts in southeastern region. However, these areas are unlikely to contain viable populations because Dholes are usually sighted only as solitary individuals, or in small groups of two to three adults. Dhole numbers appear to be decreasing in these areas due to a decreasing prey base (S. Chakma pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Bhutan</strong>: Although Dholes were nearly extirpated in Bhutan in the 1970s and early 1980s due to poisoning campaigns, this species began to re-occupy the country starting in the 1990s (Wangchuk 2004, Thinley <em>et al</em>. 2011). Based on sign and interviews with park managers, they now occur in most, if not all, protected areas in the country (J. Kamler unpubl. data).<br/><br/><strong>Cambodia</strong>: There are recent (under five years old) records of Dholes in the Cardamom Mountains (FFI-Cambodia Programme unpubl. data), the northern plains landscape (WCS Cambodia Program unpubl. data), the eastern plains landscape (J. Kamler unpubl. data), and northeastern Cambodia (Siem Pang Province; D. Willcox unpubl. data). Dholes do not likely exist in viable populations outside of these areas. A recent outbreak of canine distemper in 2011-2012, thought to have originated in local domestic dogs, caused the near-extirpation of Dholes in both the eastern and northern plains landscapes (J. Kamler and A. Suzuki unpubl. data), but it appears these populations are slowly recovering as of 2015.<br/><br/><strong>China</strong>: Historically Dholes occurred throughout China, but their current status and distribution is highly uncertain, and they are likely extirpated throughout most of the country. Despite extensive surveys throughout the country, recent (&lt;10 years) records from China come only from six provinces: Gansu, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Xinjiang. In northern Gansu Province, Dholes were recently reported from the Qilian Shan Mountains as a pack was observed there in 2003 (Harris 2006) and a mother with pups was photographed in Yanchiwan Nature Reserve in 2013 (Riordan <em>et al</em>. 2015). As the Qilian Shan Mountains extend into northern Qinghai Province, Dholes still might occur there as well. In southeastern Xinjiang Province, camera traps recorded Dholes during 2012-2013 in the Altun (Altyn-Tagh) Mountains (Xue <em>et al</em>. 2014). In western Xinjiang Province, there were sightings by local people during 2011-2013 in Taxkorgan Nature Reserve (Riordan <em>et al</em>. 2015). In central Sichuan, a Dhole was photographed in 2012 in Heishuihe Nature Reserve in the Qionglai Mountains (Y. Zhou pers. comm.). Although one Dhole was observed in 2003 in Tangjiahe Nature Reserve in northern Sichuan (Y. Zhou pers. comm.), there have been no camera trap photos or other confirmed records in the past 10 years (S. Li pers. comm.). Dholes may occur in the Minshan Mountains (northern Sichua) and Daxue Shan Mountains (western Sichuan), as there are former records from there and current prey densities are relatively high (S. Li pers. comm., Li <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Shaanxi Province, a Dhole was recently recorded during a camera trap study in Guanyinshan Nature Reserve in the Qinling Mountains (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, camera trap studies in several other nature reserves in Shaanxi failed to record Dholes (S. Li pers. comm.), so their numbers must be extremely low in the area. In Yunnan Province, Dholes were photographed in camera traps in both the Nangunhe and Xishuangbanna nature reserves in 2012-13 near the border with Myanmar (Wildlife Institute, Beijing Forestry University, unpubl.), but Dhole numbers are likely low there due to highly fragmented habitat, high poaching, and extremely low prey densities (S. Li pers. comm.). In TAR, camera traps recorded Dholes in 2014 in Motuo (Mêdog) County (southeastern TAR; S. Li pers. comm.). Although there are few recent records, Dholes may still occur in the southern parts of TAR, as this species was recorded in the Mt. Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) Nature Reserve (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014). In southeastern China, the last two records of Dholes come from Jiangxi Province: the unconfirmed report of one captured in early 2000s (C. Bellamy pers. comm.), and an unconfirmed photo taken by a camera trap in Taohongling Nature Reserve in 2010 (S. Li pers. comm.). However, there have been no confirmed reports or additional records from other areas, and they are now likely extirpated from the region. Interviews with local people suggested that Dholes disappeared from large areas of central and southern China during the 1980s and early 1990s, after locals starting poisoning carcasses in retaliation for livestock losses from Dholes (S. Li pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>India</strong>: Dholes occur in several regions of India, and this country undoubtedly contains the largest numbers of Dholes. That said, Dholes have disappeared from 60% of their historic range in India during the past 100 years (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2010). Relatively high populations of Dholes are still found in the Western Ghats and central Indian forests, due to high prey numbers and extent of protected forests, whereas lower numbers of Dholes are found in the Eastern Ghats (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2009). Dholes are also found in the northeastern states, although numbers are low and decreasing in this region due to a decreasing prey base and retaliatory killings from livestock predation (Gopi <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lyngdoh <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dholes are found in some areas of Terai region in northern India (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2009), although their exact distribution there is unknown. In the Himalayan region, Dholes were recently reported from Sikkim (Bashir <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in 2008 near Tso Kar in Ladakh (R. Simpson pers. comm.), thus they may occur in other areas of Ladakh as well.<br/><br/><strong>Indonesia (Sumatra and Java)</strong>: Historically, Dholes occurred throughout both Sumatra and Java; however, their current distribution on both islands is fragmented and greatly reduced. On Sumatra, Dholes have recently been confirmed in several national parks along the Barisan Mountain range, ranging from the northern to southern parts of the island (e.g., Gunung Leuser, Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks; FFI, WCS and WWF country programs unpubl. data). Dholes also have been recently confirmed in several protected areas in lowland forests in the east-central part of the island (e.g., Tesso Nilo and Bukit Tigapuluh National Parks, Harapan Rainforest and Batang Hari Protection Forest; FFI and WWF country programs unpubl. data). On Java, Dholes have recently been confirmed in national parks only in the extreme western (e.g., Gunung Gede Pangrango, Ujung Kulon and Gunung Halimum Salak National Parks) and eastern (e.g., Baluran National Park and Alas Purwo National Park) parts of the island (A. Ario pers. comm.). They are likely extirpated in other regions of the island.<br/><br/><strong>Korean peninsula</strong>: Historically, Dholes occurred on the Korean peninsula, but were likely extirpated throughout most of their range by the 1970s (Won and Smith 1999). In the 1980s Dholes were confirmed to still occur on Mt. Pakdoo in northeastern Korea DPR, near the Chinese border (Won and Smith 1999). However, there have been no available data since that time, so their status in Korea DPR remains uncertain. They are certainly extirpated from the Republic of Korea.<br/><br/><strong>Lao PDR</strong>: There are recent (under five years old) records of Dholes from northern Lao PDR (Nam Et-Phou Louey [NEPL] and Nam Ha protected areas) and in central Lao PDR (Nakai-Nam Theun and Nam Kading protected areas; WCS-Lao PDR program unpubl. data, C. Coudrat pers. comm.). The most studied and perhaps largest population of Dholes in the country is in NEPL (Kamler <em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no recent records of Dholes in southern Lao PDR, and they are probably extirpated from this region.<br/><br/><strong>Malaysia (peninsula)</strong>: The historical range of Dholes likely included the entire Malaysian peninsula, possibly even what is now Singapore. Dholes are now extirpated from Singapore and the southern forests of the Malaysian peninsula (Endau-Rompin complex; WCS Malaysia Program, unpubl.). Based on recent camera trapping surveys, Dholes still occur in the central (Taman Negara) and northern (Belum-Temengor complex) forested areas of the Malaysian peninsula (K. Kawanishi pers. comm.).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Myanmar</strong>: The current distribution of Dholes in Myanmar is uncertain. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, they were recorded by camera traps at 11 of 15 survey areas scattered across the country (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, numbers and distribution may have decreased since that time. For example, Dholes had been recorded in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary in western Myanmar, where they reportedly predated on livestock. Apparently, local people persecuted Dholes in retribution, and consequently Dholes were not detected in Chatthin during recent camera-trapping surveys (N. M. Shwe unpubl. data). Since 2005, Dholes have been recorded from several protected areas in Myanmar, including the northern region (Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctcuary and Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary), west-central region (Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary and Namataung National Park), southwestern region (Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range), and peninsula region (Tanintharyi Nature Reserve; WCS Myanmar Program unpubl. data). From 1999-2002, Dholes were recorded in at least eight additional forest tracts and protected areas the in northern, western, and central parts of the country (WCS Myanmar Program unpubl. data), thus Dholes may still occur throughout these regions. There are few confirmed records of Dholes from eastern Myanmar, although they likely occur near the tri-border area with Lao PDR and Thailand, as there are records in that area from those countries. There are recent records of dholes from camera-trap studies in Karen (Kayin) State (R. McEwing pers. comm.), but their status in other areas of eastern Myanmar is not known.<br/><br/><strong>Nepal</strong>: Dhole sightings in Nepal are not common, yet there are recent reports of this species in several areas of country. In the Himalayan region, Dholes reportedly occur in the western (Rara and Khaptad National Parks, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve; R. D. Choudhary pers. comm., A. Aryal in litt.) and extreme eastern parts (Kanchenjunga Conservation Area; Khatiwada 2011) of the country. In southern Nepal, Dholes are found throughout much of the Terai Arc Landscape, including Chitwan and Bardia national parks (Thapa <em>et al</em>. 2013, A. Khatiwada pers. comm.), and Parsa and Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserves (A. Khatiwada pers. comm.). Dholes also are reported in several districts of Nepal outside protected areas, but all populations are extremely low and threatened by low prey base, poisoning and habitat loss (A. Khatiwada pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Pakistan</strong>: Although there are no confirmed records of Dholes from Pakistan, they historically occurred in the western Himalayan Mountains in the northern part of the country. They might still occur in the Ladakh region of northern Parkistan, as Dholes recently have been recorded in the India-administered region of Ladakh.<br/><br/><strong>Thailand</strong>: Dholes have been extirpated from most areas of Thailand, and are now absent from the peninsula and eastern parts of the country. Dholes are still found in fragmented populations in several large protected-area complexes, including the south-central region (Phayayen-Khao Yai and Eastern Forest complexes), north-central region (Phumieng-Phuthong and Phukhieo-Namnow complexes), northwestern region (Srilanna-Khutan and Doi Phucar-Maeyom complexes), and western region (Western Forest Complex; Jenks <em>et al. </em>2012; Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Thailand). It is not yet known how stable are these isolated populations, and if the protected-area complexes are large enough to conserve viable Dhole populations in the long term.<br/><br/><strong>Viet Nam</strong>: There are very few recent confirmed records on Dholes in Viet Nam. The last confirmed records of Dholes were in Pu Mat National Park in 1998-99 (D. Willcox pers. comm.) and in Yok Don National Park in 2003 (J. Eames pers. comm.) despite extensive camera trapping in &gt;25 protected areas throughout the country. Along with other large carnivores, Dholes are likely extirpated from Viet Nam, although individuals may occasionally enter the country from neighboring Cambodia or Lao PDR","There is no widespread exploitation of Dholes for fur or other purposes, and there apparently is little if any value for their use as traditional medicines. Thus, wildlife trade does not directly affect Dholes.",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legal protection</strong><br/>It is included in CITES – Appendix II (2013).&#160;Dholes are legally protected in the countries where they occur. However, enforcement of laws is insufficient to provide effective protection of Dholes in many of their range countries. Local governments sometimes may still offer bounties on Dholes to reduce livestock predation, as was recently the case in western Myanmar. In Thailand, Dholes were recently blamed for the decline of wild ungulates in some protected areas, and as a result some government officials have proposed to eliminate Dholes from those areas (K. Jenks and N. Songsasen unpubl.). Dholes also may have been intentionally extirpated from some protected areas by local officials in southeastern China in an attempt to boost ungulate numbers (S. Li pers. comm.). Providing compensation, incentives or insurance for livestock-Dhole conflicts to reduce retaliatory killing of Dholes may be a good conservation strategy and should be tested (Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Gurung <em>et al</em>. 2011). Similarly, incentives for conservation of habitat, Dholes and their prey should be explored.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Although this species occurs in protected areas throughout its range, there are no conservation measures specifically focused on Dholes, except for a few isolated localities like eastern Nepal. For the putative northern Dholes, their occurrence in China was recently confirmed by camera traps in several isolated nature reserves. However, lack of data on numbers of Dholes and their prey in these reserves prevent a valid assessment as to their potential for conserving Dholes in the long-term. For the putative southern Dholes, both Project Tiger and Project Elephant in India have the potential to conserve populations of Dholes and their prey in areas where they coexist with tigers and elephants. However, Dholes require up to five times the land area as tigers to maintain viable long-term populations, and consequently Dholes have disappeared from more reserves than have tigers (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998). Thus, relatively large (&gt;750 km<sup>2</sup>) reserves in India might be the most effective for conserving Dhole populations. Large protected-area complexes for Tiger conservation in Bhutan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Indonesia (Sumatra), and Thailand, also are conserving Dhole populations, thus these areas hold the greatest potential for the long-term conservation of Dholes in South and Southeast Asia. Consolidating more forest areas and including them in protected area networks would greatly enhance the conservation of Dholes in these regions.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>As of August 2013, there were at least 223 Dholes in 38 zoos worldwide (International Species Information System [ISIS] unpubl.), including zoos in Europe (24 zoos), Asia (nine zoos), North America (four zoos), and Australia (one zoo). There also are captive Dholes in additional zoos and breeding farms which are not members of ISIS. The origin of most captive Dholes is unclear, and their subspecific classification is probably wrong. The most numerous subspecies in captivity is listed as <em>C. a. lepturus</em>, which occurs in at least 20 zoos worldwide and is the most common Dhole in European zoos. Firstly, inbreeding may be an issue because captive Dholes listed as <em>lepturus </em>trace their origin to only three founders: a single Dhole from a game farm in North America with an unknown origin (H. Maisch pers. comm.), and Dholes from the Moscow Zoo, which originated from only two individuals captured in Qinghai Province, China in 1957 (Sosnovskii 1967). Secondly, the Dholes captured in Qinghai Province should represent either <em>C. a. hesperius</em> or <em>C. a. fumosus</em>, from the putative northern Dhole group, rather than <em>lepturus </em>which historically occurred only south of the Yangtze River and is part of the southern Dhole group (Durbin et al. 2004). The putative southern Dholes are represented in several Indian zoos (probably <em>C. alpinus dukhunensis</em>), and in zoos in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Sydney, Australia (<em>C. alpinus infuscus</em>). Other zoos do not list subspecies, thus it is likely that putative subspecies from different origins have been interbred (M. Boeer pers. comm.), such as that done in Singapore Zoo. The European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) does not consider subspecies, but it does regard Dholes in European zoos as a Chinese ecotype, and prevents mixing this type with Dholes from other origins (e.g., India, Cambodia). Nevertheless, the value of any of captive Dholes for potential reintroduction efforts is uncertain, at least until genetic studies can confirm their origin and subspecific classification. Until that time, we recommend that captive Dholes from the putative northern and southern groups be managed separately, such as that done by the EEP.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Research needs</strong><br/>More research is needed on Dholes to better understand their ecology and assist conservation efforts. These include: 1) develop cost-effective surveys to determine the abundance of Dholes, as data on Dhole numbers would allow us to better understand their conservation status; 2) investigate the genetic and morphological differences between the putative northern and southern Dholes, and the distinctiveness of other putative subspecies such as the Sumatran and Javan Dholes; 3) determine the area and prey requirements needed to maintain a viable Dhole population; 4) investigate the effects of disease on Dhole population dynamics, and; 5) investigate effects of Dholes on ecosystems, specifically their interactions with other large carnivores, and their impacts on prey and smaller carnivores.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

There is no credible quantification of decline rate from anywhere in the species' range. The overall forest loss rate at appropriate altitudes&#160;in the species' range is suspected to be sufficient for Near Threatened status (about 25% in the last three generations), but Red Panda populations are suspected to be declining much faster, reflecting a battery of direct threats, this species' fragmented present range, and poor survival in fragmented areas. (1)&#160;Red Panda diet is 98% bamboo. These plants&#160;show mass flowering followed by die off. Red Pandas will not readily find new feeding grounds in a highly fragmented landscape and are exposed to other threats when crossing unsuitable habitat. These bamboos do not easily re-establish after flowering in areas of environmental degradation and deforestation, which are now widespread across the&#160;species's range. (2)&#160;Red Pandas are highly susceptible to canine distemper (even developing the disease after vaccination with&#160;domestic dog vaccine), which is lethal to them. As more people, particularly herders, encroach Red Panda habitat, contact between domestic dogs (and their excreta) and Red Pandas increases. Unless all dogs (including feral ones) in Red Panda habitat are vaccinated against this disease the chance that it will enter and spread in the wild Red Panda population with catastrophic consequences are high. (3)&#160;Red Panda has specific habitat requirements for forest type, altitude, slope gradient and aspect, proximity to water courses, precipitation and presence of tree stumps. The gentle slopes and rich bamboo understorey of Red Panda habitat make it also a prime choice for herders with their dogs. Cattle also prefer these more gentle slopes, so trample bamboo, which is also collected extensively by herdsmen and used for fodder. In addition tree stumps are often collected by local villagers for firewood. (4)&#160;Hunting for trade seems to be increasing, Red Pandas are starting to enter the pet trade, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of ‘cute’ images on social media. Deforestation and road building are easing access to Red Panda habitat. There are reports of poachers capturing Red Pandas in Nepal and Myanmar to satisfy the Chinese demand for the species (as wild meat, for medicine and for skins). The smaller population fragments, such as in&#160;Nepal, can support little or no off-take. (5)&#160;The human population in the Eastern Himalayas is growing at an average rate of 2.1% (doubling time 33 years). With this growth more people are moving into Red Panda habitat for their livelihoods, thereby exacerbating the above threats. Yonzon and Hunter (1991) showed that Red Panda mortality is high in disturbed areas; in their study area only three of the 12-13 cubs born survived to&#160;six&#160;months and only five of the nine adults survived the study period. They stated that 57% of these deaths were directly related to human causes. Comparable figures from undisturbed habitat are not available; but annual mortality rates such as these cannot possibly be&#160;sustainable.<br/><br/>The Ailuridae comprises a monospecific family. In part for this reason of conservation priority, with the evidence of precise decline rate being inadequate for certain discrimination between Vulnerable and Endangered, the precautionary course is taken of categorisation as Endangered, pending more precise information.","<p>Red Panda is closely associated with montane forests (oak mixed; mixed broad-leaf conifer; and conifer) with dense bamboo-thicket understorey (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). Conifer/fir forests seem to be preferred (Yonzon and Hunter 1991). Habitats above the tree-line are probably not consistently occupied given that Red Panda is essentially arboreal (Choudhury 2001). A dead Red Panda at 4,325 m asl in Arunachal Pradesh, in an area where the species is not generally known and far from any typical Red Panda habitat, was presumably a dispersant (Dorjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Six studies reported that Red Panda prefers to live near (typically within 100–200 m of) water (e.g., Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001). Five indicated a preference for canopy cover above 30%, with some suggesting cover as high as 70–80% may be preferred. Three suggested a preference for slopes of below 45%. Several indicated a preference for slope aspect: most suggest avoidance of south-facing slopes in favour of the cooler climate of the north, northwest and northeast aspects (Yonzon and Hunter 1991, Pradhan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Mahato 2004,&#160;Mallick 2010,&#160;Jhoshi and Sangam 2011,&#160;Subedi and Thapa 2011,&#160;Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Panthi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sharma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Sagamartha National Park, Red Panda was found on south-facing slopes in only one of six study areas, at lower density than at similar altitudes on north-facing slopes. In another area where both north- and south-facing slopes had otherwise similar habitat, Red Panda was found only on the north-facing slopes (Mahato 2004). Only in China have there been reports that Red Panda prefers south-facing slopes (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013). All studies investigating aspect took place in a similar altitude range. Also in China, in contrast to the rest of the range, steep slopes of more than 45% seemed preferred. Perhaps this relates to sympatry with Giant Panda <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>&#160;(in the Minshan, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling ranges in western Sichuan; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a, 2000), which uses the more gentle slopes. Zhang <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that Red Panda prefers microhabitats with higher densities of fallen logs and tree stumps.</p><p> Red Panda is largely vegetarian, eating chiefly young leaves and shoots of bamboo. It also takes fruit, roots, succulent grasses, acorns, lichens, birds' eggs and insects (Hodgson 1847, Sowerby 1932). It is largely arboreal (Hodgson 1847).<br/> <br/> Gestation in captivity lasts 114–145 days (Northrop and Czekala 2011), suggesting a variable delay in embryo implantation. The animals breed once per year giving birth in the summer (late May to early August in northern hemisphere zoos). In captivity, litter sizes range from one to four, most commonly one to two; quadruplets are exceedingly rare. In the field, Yonzon and Hunter (1991) reported litters usually of singletons or twins. The young are sexually mature at 18 months and females can give birth for the first time around their second birthday. In captivity the generation length is around five to six years and its average longevity around 12–14 years. This slow reproductive rate and relatively long generation time are typical of a k-selected species, adapted to a stable environment and less capable of survival when that environment starts changing rapidly.<br/> </p>","<p>Each of the three recent&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs)&#160;listed the threats to Red Panda assessed to be most prevalent in their country/countries. Several problems occur throughout the species's range, albeit with some variation in assessed impact. The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat degradation; and physical threats. These are all compounded by the region's increasing human population;<span class=""a1""> climate change; natural disasters; inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations; mostly low political will and interest; political instability (in some regions); low coordination of stakeholders, funding and human resources; trans-boundary issues facilitating poaching, illegal collection of non-timber forest products, and Red Panda trade (skins and other body parts); and the movement of cattle herders/grazers during the breeding season.<br/> <br/> <span class=""a1"">Natural disasters include cyclones; landslides; floods; heavy snowfall and rainfall; bamboo flowering (which results in death of the plant and typically occurs synchronously across large areas); forest fires; poor regeneration of shelter trees; weed infestation and invasive alien species; and disease outbreaks. Although most of these have been in operation throughout Red Panda existence, their effects are increasingly severe as an ever-larger proportion of the distribution is outside contiguous habitat blocks&#160;large enough&#160;for recolonisation to occur post-disaster.</span></p><p><span class=""a1""><span class=""a1""> In some areas, habitat is lost and degraded by commercial logging. In the Emaw Bum region of Myanmar more&#160;than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> have been logged since 1999–2000, resulting in many new roads into mountain areas, e.g. between the May Hka river and the China border. These logging roads not only&#160;destroy&#160;habitat&#160;directly, they also facilitate access for hunters and can destabilise the substrate. A recent video report from FFI shows two young Red Pandas crossing a landslide, the result of foreign road-building in the area.<br/> <br/> As human populations grow, more people move into mountain regions to live. They clear land for habitation, bring domestic herds to roam in the forests where they trample and eat bamboo. Herders collect bamboo for fodder and other necessities. The herds are protected by dogs that attack pandas and, if not vaccinated, potentially carry canine distemper, fatal to Red Panda. The lack of annual vaccination in India, at least, leads to a high incidence of canine distemper in dogs of one to five years of age (Latha <em>et al</em>. 2007). Spillover of canine distemper into wild species is already well documented, such as to Indian Fox <em>Vulpes bengalensis</em> (Vanak <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>&#160;(e.g. Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Himalayan bamboos, the Red Panda’s dietary staple, are sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire and overgrazing (Stapleton 1996). Reduced canopy cover increases wind and water stress for the bamboo. In these situations, seedlings are destroyed by the harsh conditions coupled with grazing pressure.<br/> <br/> Reports of Red Panda poaching and smuggling seem to be increasing, perhaps through demand in China.&#160;F. Momberg (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;saw Red Panda carcases and skins in&#160;villagers'&#160;homes in eastern Myanmar. One hunter allowed him to accompany him while he caught a Red Panda with his hands; apparently these villagers regularly take Red Pandas. Wildlife trade is rampant in Myanmar (about 30 tons of wildlife products per month), facilitated by wildlife habitat proximity to the Chinese border. Before Red Panda was upgraded to Appendix I of CITES in the early 1990s, individuals captured in Myanmar were traded by China to zoos around the world.&#160;<br/> <br/> Ang Phuri Sherpa (pers. comm. 2015) &#160;reported an increase in illegal trade over the preceding three years, based on the number of poachers and traders caught in Nepal. These incidents mostly involved skins and the items were headed for China. One incident involved a live Red Panda. A general increase in interest in Red Panda skins and meat in China could fuel more trade. A US businessman reported Red Pandas on offer in a restaurant. In the 'Threats' discussions during the 2012 Red Panda PHVA in China, many Chinese participants indicated that Red Panda meat was fairly widely available in restaurants, although no details are available. &#160;<br/> <br/> The live Red Panda trade, for pets, also seems to be increasing. Ian Lee (Chinese representative for Red Panda Network, pers. comm. 2015) found several reports in Chinese newspapers and social media of Red Pandas for sale as pets. This corroborates indications that Red Panda is increasing in popularity as a pet in China and other Asian countries, notably Thailand (YouTube videos and Instagram photos).<br/> <br/> Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) considers hunting and poaching the major threat to the Red Panda in Myanmar, in two ways: in one area, Red Panda is not a target species but is caught in iron traps, and some of skins are traded; in another, live Red Pandas are traded to China, motivating local people to go to catch them whenever they have time.<br/> </span></p>","<p>Red Panda was “estimated to be more common in the eastern part of its range, especially along the Myanmar-Yunnan border, yet it cannot be considered a common species” (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). There have been four undertakings to estimate, per country, the area of occupied habitat and from this the approximate Red Panda population: Choudhury (2001), Mahato (2010), the recent Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs; held in Nepal in 2010, China in 2012, and India in 2013) and Kendal <em>et al</em>. (2015). These show very little concordance (<span style="""">see Table 1 in the&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Supplementary Material</span>) and whilst some differences might reflect real change between earlier and later assessments, most must stem from differing assumptions and techniques. The PHVA figures are taken here as the most realistic guides, although none has been corrected for suitability of gross area of broadly suitable habitat accounting for specific preferences. Yet Red Panda is selective in forest used with regard to level of annual rainfall, percentage canopy cover, and density of bamboo (e.g., Yonzon <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). These would ideally all be taken into account when estimating area of potential habitat. In addition, Red Panda is usually found near water-courses and in areas with many tree stumps, and apparently prefers medium-gradient or shallower, north-facing slopes. In combination, these factors will make the area occupied at average to high densities substantially below that of potential habitat. For example, taking into account forest type, altitude, precipitation and slope aspect, Yonzon <em>et al. </em>(1991) estimated only 68 km<sup>2</sup> of the 1,719 km<sup>2</sup> Langtang National Park to comprise suitable Red Panda habitat.</p><p> Regardless of the uncertainty of actual area occupied, increases in human population and the continuing spread of human activity has driven habitat loss and degradation since the assessment of Choudhury (2001).<br/> <br/> <strong>Nepal</strong>. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i), with numbers low (317–582 – similar to the prediction by Yonzon <em>et al.</em> 1997) and a declining population fragmented into 11 subpopulations. These data are extracted from the PHVA report. Subsequent surveys of Api Nampa (Arjun Thapa pers. comm. 2014) and Khaptad (Hari P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011) did not confirm the survival of these two subpopulations. The following estimates of density/numbers have been reported:&#160;<strong>Rara: </strong>about one animal per 3 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly between 3,100 and 3,600 m asl because of fragmentation and disturbance below this, and reduced habitat suitability above; a maximum of 11 Red Pandas in a 35&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;study area (Sharma 2008, Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014). <strong>Langtang</strong>: one per 2.09&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;giving a total of 68 Red Pandas in the park (Yonzon 1989), but Yonzon <em>et al</em>. (1991)&#160;reassessed the Langtang population at 24. This apparent decline, of 65% in less than two to three years, was probably real, reflecting high mortality resulting from anthropogenic disturbance in the park. <strong>Panchthar – Ilam – Tapeljung:</strong>&#160;one per 5.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;– 100 animals in 178&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Williams 2003, 2004). <strong>Dhorpatan: </strong>animals present but no density or population estimates available<strong>.</strong> Most Red Pandas occur over 3,200–3,400 m asl (Subedi and Thapa 2011) or 3,000–3,800 m asl (Panthi <em>et al</em>. 2012), and suffer disturbance from local people for livestock and collection of forest products. <strong>Bhotkola:&#160;</strong>135&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;good Red Panda habitat holds about 30–46 Red Pandas (Joshi and Sangam 2011).<br/> <br/> <strong>India: the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. Participants in the 2013 PHVA calculated that the amount of habitat available for Red Panda in Sikkim and Arunachal was 6,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. More rigid constraints on assessing habitat as 'suitable' gave merely 2,600&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. Even with the more relaxed habitat conditions, this area is only half that proposed for India by Choudhury (2001), although the comparison is complicated by the non-availability of 2013 figures for West Bengal. Given the changes in land use in the last 20 year, the area of potential Red Panda habitat has undoubtedly declined, although direct comparison between PHVA data and those published by Choudhury is unwise: Choudhury estimated Red Panda habitat from forest service maps and national park maps, whereas the PHVA evaluation used current satellite imagery. In Sikkim, 225–370 Red Pandas in 650&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable forest were calculated by Ziegler <em>et al</em>. (2010); the PHVA estimate was of 44–415. In West Bengal (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">not included in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material</span>), a statement of 78 Red Pandas in Singalila (Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001) contrasts with a more recent one of 27 animals (Roka and Jha 2014) and a similar number stated by Bahaguna <em>et al</em>. (1998). This figure plus the 28–32 animals stated to live in the Neora Valley by Mallick (2010) gives a total of 55–60 Red Pandas in West Bengal. In Arunachal Pradesh there have been fewer site-specific studies. This state is presumed to hold the largest Red Panda population in India. According to Choudhury (2001) it was relatively common in Tawang and northern West Kameng districts and in the Mishmi Hills, especially Dibang Valley and Lohit districts. Ghose and Dutta (2011) reported sightings of Red Pandas from&#160;several&#160;districts, all from before 2000. Habitat maps suggest that most Red Panda habitat is in the east of the state, with a second concentration in the west, around Tawang and Eaglesnest. The habitat between these two regions looks more sparse and fragmented.<br/> <br/> <strong>Bhutan.</strong> Red Panda seems to be widely distributed, mostly at 2,400–3,700 m asl. Bhutan is a very small country with a fast developing economy. The road system is expanding fast and the growing rural population depends on forest and forest products. Even in this country, the pressure on Red Panda habitat is marked.<br/> <br/> <strong>Myanmar</strong>. The area where Red Panda is found (northern Kachin province) is remote, with recent locality records from Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, Mount Majed and Emaw Bum, mostly above 3,000 m asl. The number of villager captures suggests the species may be common in Hkakaborazi National Park, but none was camera-trapped there despite substantial effort at suitable altitude (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) believes Red Panda is still fairly common in the Emaw Bum region, albeit much disturbed by logging and hunting. Red Panda is presumably less common than formerly in Myanmar and, although apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, it is still caught and killed.<br/> <br/> <strong>China. </strong>China is the only country for which the PHVA estimated much higher forest cover than did Choudhury (2001). Choudhury’s (2001) estimates were supported by Wei <em>et al</em>. (1999, 2011). As Wei <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported, reforested lands (which are increasing, reflecting government policy) do not provide suitable Red Panda habitat. Red Panda perhaps decreased in China by as much as 40% in the second half of the twentieth century, through massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching (Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999). Wei <em>et al.</em> (1999) estimated 3,000–7,000 Red Pandas in China.<br/> </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The current Red Panda distribution is detailed in three Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs) since 2010, covering all range states holding the species: Nepal (2010), China and Myanmar (2012), and India and Bhutan (2013). As discussed by Roberts and Gittleman (1984),&#160;Red Panda&#160;distribution range should be considered disjunct, not continuous. Reports, including a shot animal of undoubted identification and provenance, of a population on the Meghalaya Plateau of northeastern India, in anomalously tropical habitat (Choudhury 2001, Duckworth 2011) warrant investigation as soon as possible. Captive&#160;Red Pandas from the main distribution and habitat do not breed well in tropical conditions (Princee and Glatston in prep); the Meghalaya Red Pandas, if native, might be a separate taxon.</p><p> In Nepal&#160;Red Panda&#160;has been reported from 23 districts, but a number lack confirmed specific records. A further district, Darchula, contains suitable habitat but so far lacks any Red Panda reports. The westernmost global reports are from the Api Nampa Conservation Area and Khaptad in far western Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), but specific verifiable records there have not been traced since the 2010 PHVA,&#160;even though local people had affirmed Red Panda in these areas in the recent past. Two post-PHVA surveys failed to find the species in either area (H.P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011,&#160;A. Thapa pers. comm. 2014). The westernmost confirmed records are from Kalikot and Jumla at about 81°E (Dangol 2014); both are west of the formerly accepted range. In Bhutan it is found in 13 districts (Haa, Thimphu, Paro, Punakha, Wangdiphodrang, Gasa, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Bumthang, Mongar, Lhuntse, Trashigang and Trashiyangtse); high-elevation areas in other districts (Chukha, Tsirang, Dagana, Samtse and Samdrupjongkhar) require further surveys (Dorjii <em>et al. </em>2012). In India it is found in only three states: Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. In Myanmar it is known only from the northernmost state, Kachin, and is locally distributed even there (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). In China it is found in three provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet. Sichuan is its main homeland. In this province its range extends through the Minshan and Liangshan to Qionglai and the Lesser and Greater Xiangling mountains (Wei <em>et al</em>.1999, 2011). It is believed to be extinct in the rest of its historical range in China, e.g. Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces (Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Xiaoxiangling population appears isolated from the other <em>A. f. styani </em>population(s). It is a small population and represents a different genetic type that should be considered as a separate conservation unit (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda was&#160;stated to inhabit Lao PDR by Cheminaud (1942) and Deuve (1972). Re-examination of Cheminaud (1942) reveals many significant internal inconsistencies and flaws. Hence, there is no evidence that Red Panda has ever occurred in Lao PDR (Duckworth 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda occurs in a narrow altitude band. Roberts and Gittleman (1984) gave a range of 2,500–4,000 m asl. Prater (1948) mentioned occurrence down to 1,500 m asl and Choudhury (2001) gave a typical range of 1,500–4,800 m asl, up to nearly 5,000 m asl in the summer. However all recent publications, excepting those discussing animals from Meghalaya, support the Roberts and Gittleman range as that typically occupied, notwithstanding sporadic reports above 4,000 m asl and down to 2,300 m asl. The occupied altitude varies across the range. This might result from any of: disturbance at lower altitudes; time of year of assessment (several authors indicate that Red Pandas migrate seasonally up and down the mountainside; e.g., Yonzon and Hunter 1991); aspect (with animals occurring higher on the warmer south-facing slopes); and potentially other factors.<br/> </p>","Red Panda is taken for various purposes including wild meat, medicine, pelts and pets. Levels of offtake are not well documented; nor are trends in offtake or geographical patterns of harvest and use. It has been&#160;suggested that the rising numbers in the internet pet trade in China are captive-bred, but this remains&#160;to be confirmed.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Red Panda is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I (www.cites.org). It is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972, the highest protection possible for a species in India (Choudhury 2001). It is also legally protected in Bhutan, China (where it is classed as a Category II species under the Wild Animal Protection Law; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a), Nepal (Glatston 1994) and Myanmar (by the Wildlife Act of 1994). In China, the species is Red Listed nationally as 'Vulnerable' under A2ace. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i),&#160;<br/> <br/> In Myanmar it is found in at least three protected areas: Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and Emaw Bum proposed National Park. It is difficult to determine how much of the Red Panda’s range in the country these protected areas cover. Hunting and, in Emaw Bum, logging are widespread within their confines.<br/> <br/> In Bhutan it is found in the following protected areas: Jigme Dorji, Thrumshingla and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks, Bumdeling and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuaries, Toorsa Strict Nature Reserve, biological corridors connecting these reserves, and the biological corridor connecting Thrumshingla and Royal Manas National Parks. It has also been recorded in the Royal Botanical Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Wangchuck Centennial Park (Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012). Potential Red Panda habitat in the country modelled using MAXENT and ArcGIS 9.3 revealed 46% of predicted Red Panda habitat is under protected areas (PAs), 16% is in biological corridors and 38% lies outside the PA system. However, even protected areas are subject to activities such as road construction, livestock grazing, subsistence agriculture (slash-and-burn in some areas), collection of forest resources such as timber and NTFPs, and domestic dog presence.<br/> <br/> In India it is found in 19 protected or otherwise managed&#160;areas: Lachung Reserve Forest, Kanchendzonga National Park (NP), Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary,&#160;the buffer and transition area of the latter two,&#160;Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), Pangolakha WLS, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary, Singalila NP, Neora Valley NP, Kamlang WLS, Eaglesnest WLS, Zemithang Valley Community Forest, Nuranang Valley Community Forest, Mehao WLS, Mandla-Phudung CF, Anjaw Reserve forest, Mechuka-West Siang CF, Mouling NP and Dibang WLS. It might also inhabit Taley Valley WLS, Pakhui WLS and Sessa Orchid Sanctuary. These protected areas cover about one-third of the species’s total potential habitat in India (Choudhury 2001). In the 2013&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA)&#160;workshop, 22 protected areas (outside Meghalaya) were identified as having potential habitat for Red Panda, some with only very small areas. Furthermore, the workshop participants identified medium to high levels of threat in these areas from&#160;two or more of development activities; fire; herders; firewood and non-timber forest product collection; illegal trade/'accidental' hunting; dogs (very prevalent); refuse; and habitat reduction. In Arunachal Pradesh (the state believed to have the largest Red Panda population in India) around 60% of the forest is under community ownership rather than having PA status. Also in Sikkim, 60% of potential Red Panda habitat falls outside the PA system. Enforcement of protective legislation, especially outside protected areas, is almost non-existent (Choudhury 2001).</p><p> China has 46 protected areas containing Red Panda (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2011), covering about 65% of the species’s habitat in China. Poor law enforcement in PAs was listed as a problem during the 2012 PHVA workshop (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2014). Livestock grazing and collection of non-timber forest products occur widely in these areas.<br/> <br/> Red Panda has been confirmed in nine of Nepal’s PAs: Sagarmatha NP; Makalu Barun NP; Langtang NP; Rara NP; Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (CA); Annapurna CA; Gaurishankar CA; Manaslu Conservation Area; and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. In all these PAs, habitat loss and degradation, poaching and dog problems and developmental activities have been rated as moderate to severe by participants in the Red Panda PHVA workshop (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Currently there is a Global&#160;Species&#160;Management Plan (GSMP) for Red Pandas held in zoos around the world. This plan is closely allied to&#160;current field&#160;conservation efforts. The three PHVAs were largely the initiative of, and funded by, the zoo community. The aims of the GSMP are to contribute both directly and indirectly to Red Panda conservation by: providing a genetically and demographically sustainable and behaviourally competent back-up population for the wild population; holding the potential to supply individuals for genetic or demographic supplementation or reintroduction programmes; educating and the raising of public awareness of Red Panda, its uniqueness and conservation needs; and providing financial, technical, scientific and other support and expertise to the planning and implementation of <em>in situ</em> conservation and research &#160; <br/> <br/> Priority conservation actions fall into four main categories:<br/> <br/> 1. <u>To protect against habitat loss</u>: improve and manage Red Panda habitats (including within corridors); improve connectivity, including across international borders; balance developmental activities by promoting eco-friendly and sustainable development with minimal impact on Red Panda habitat; increase areas under protection; implement better Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for all development programmes; engage political willingness and win support;  develop and implement landscape-level conservation policy, identifying unprotected Red Panda habitat and &#160;making legal provision for the declaration of Red Panda Community Conservation Areas.<br/> <br/> 2. <u>To reduce habitat degradation</u>: restore degraded habitats, plant bamboo; regulate tourism by the use of entry permits; zone PAs to define&#160;restricted-access zones in core areas for Red Pandas, facility  zones, and resource use zones, with restricted visitor access during the breeding season (set quotas for&#160;non-timber forest products); educate, sensitise, and promote community participation to reduce and mitigate threats to Red Panda and its habitat; promote the use of alternative energy and building materials; provide sustainable livelihoods; enhance range-land management, using native species; reduce livestock numbers, especially of&#160; unproductive breeds; develop an integrated agriculture, pasture and  agroforestry system; develop proper rubbish disposal systems; improve community stewardship in natural  resources management; improve fire-fighting, in part by training communities, developing a national fire fighting strategy, ensuring PA&#160;management plans include comprehensive coverage of forest fire (the implementation of a fire strategy including forest fire alert and monitoring system, forest fire mapping and zoning, provision of fire fighting equipment, and controlled burning to prevent fires).<br/> <br/> 3. <u>To reduce deaths of Red Pandas:</u>&#160;strengthen law enforcement and improve physical protection; enhance transboundary cooperation on both of the former; strengthen coordination/collaboration between  line agencies and other stakeholders; implement a reward and punishment system both for  communities and forest department; establish anti-poaching units (in community forests and PAs) with capacity building for front-line, anti-poaching staff; train customs officials; reintroduce captive-bred individuals to reinforce local populations; formulate a dog management plan to control, sterilise and vaccinate dogs; engage army personnel in border bases to keep their dogs in check and not let them roam free in Red Panda areas.</p><p> 4. <u>To improve awareness</u>: design and implement a dedicated awareness programme using radio, pamphlets, posters, and documentary film; secure adequate funding; improve conservation education (with a focus on Red Pandas) in schools; establish/strengthen Green Force Clubs; implement a Red Panda research programme, identifying priority research topics, and including regular monitoring of its habitat; develop a trans-national ‘Project Red Panda’.<br/> </p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

The species uses olfaction to locate prey and is prey selective: in Pakistan, two species of black ants, <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">Camponotus confucii</em> and <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">C. compressus</em> comprised the majority of prey consumed, with one termite species, <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">Odontotermi sobesus</em> comprising a much smaller proportion based on fecal analysis in the Potohar Plateau (Irshad<em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;""> et al.</em> 2015).<br/>The Indian Pangolin is generally solitary, nocturnal and burrow-dwelling except when mating, when adult males and females share the same burrow, which are often under large rocks and the entrance concealed by dirt (Prater 1971, Roberts 1977, Tikader 1983). Adult Indian Pangolins weigh 10-20 kg and grow to up to 148 cm long (Mahmood<em> et al. </em>2019). The species displays sexual dimorphism, where males are generally larger and heavier than females (Roberts 1977). The tail, often almost the same length as the body (Irshad <em>et al</em>. 2016), is used for climbing trees and for balance when walking (Prater 1971). Similarly, this species possesses a long tongue, reaching up to 42.5 cm in length, which is used to capture and ingest prey (Irshad <em>et al</em>. 2016). Individuals have strong forelimbs with large and powerful claws used for excavating ant nests and termite mounds, as well as for grip when climbing. Vital for seeking prey and searching for a mate, the Indian Pangolin has excellent olfactory senses (Roberts 1977). Females usually give birth to one young, although twins are reported (Mahmood<em> et al. </em>2015b) after a gestation period of approximately six months. Juveniles are nursed by the mother, who will coil around her young (Acharjyo 2000, Mohapatra and Panda 2014) and carry it on her tail for protection whilst foraging (Roberts 1977, Israel <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 1987). It is estimated sexual maturity is reached at 3 years (see Mahmood <em>et al</em>. 2019). Longevity in the wild is unknown, but in captivity an individual persisted for 19 years (Weigl 2005). Although mainly ground-dwelling, this species is arboreal in some habitats, and is a good climber, using its prehensile tail and claws to climb trees (Prater 1971, Heath 1995).","<p>The Indian Pangolin is primarily threatened by overexploitation including hunting and poaching for both its meat and scales which are used and consumed at a local, subsistence level, but increasingly for illegal international trade (Misra and Hanfee 2000; Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018). This species has historically been exploited locally. Its meat is consumed as a source of protein locally (e.g., in India, Kanagavel <em>et al.</em> 2016) and its scales have been used in whole or powdered form in the preparation of traditional medicines and as curios in Pakistan (Roberts 1977). There is evidence that the species is being severely impacted in Pakistan i.e. directly targeted and killed so the scales can be removed and illegally exported to China and it is suspected that this has caused local extirpations (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012). In India, hunting of pangolins has been recorded in Arunachal Pradesh, and specifically regarding the Indian Pangolin hunting/poaching is known to occur Periyar Tiger reserve (Kerala), the Western Ghats and eastern states of India including Odisha (Mitra 1998, Misra and Hanfee 2000; Gubbi and Linkie 2012). There are also reports of the involvement of tribal communities such as <em>Padhis, Saperas, Bawarias </em>and <em>Mongias </em>in the capture of pangolins (Sharma 2014) and pangolin scales have reportedly increased in price (prior to export) in India in the last 20 years (Chinlampianga<em> et al.</em> 2013). The meat, bile, scales and claws of pangolins are reportedly used by tribal communities including the <em>Paaudi Bhuanya </em>tribe of Odisha, <em>Biate </em>tribe of Assam, <em>Katkaris </em>folk of Maharashtra, <em>Gond </em>tribe of Madhya Pradesh, and <em>Mizo </em>ethnic group of Mizoram (Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015). D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> (2018) report that pangolins, both Chinese and Indian species continue to be hunted and consumed locally, but the scales are illegally exported because of the high financial returns available.</p><p>There has been limited trade in this species reported to CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (see Challender and Waterman 2017). <span lang=""EN-US"">However, the species has been trafficked since at least the early 2000s for consumptive use in China (Wu and Ma 2007). International t<span lang=""EN-US"">rafficking today primarily involves scales, which are sourced from all range states, including Sri Lanka, and are primarily destined for China. T<span lang=""EN-US"">he scales are either shipped directly (e.g., by post) or are trafficked along routes through Myanmar and Nepal (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017, Perera <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is estimated that between 2011 and 2017 at least 1724 Indian Pangolin were trafficked internationally (Challender and Waterman 2017) though the actual number involved is likely much higher. This is partly because of low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade and because the species of pangolin involved in wildlife trafficking are rarely identified. Challender<em> et al.</em> (2019) report that between 2000 and 2018, a combination of live animals, dead individuals and parts and derivatives equating to an estimated 300,000 Asian pangolins were trafficked globally. Trafficking in the Indian Pangolin may be related to declines in populations of the Chinese and Sunda Pangolins, and potentially <span lang=""EN-US"">increasing awareness of the monetary value of scales (D’Cruze <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;</span></span></p><p>Other threats<span lang=""EN-US""> include the expansion of agriculture, habitat loss and deterioration, which opens up previously inaccessible areas to hunting and poaching, pesticide use and roadkill (Karawita <em>et al.</em> 2018, Murthy and Mishra 2010).</p>","<p>There is very limited information or data on population of this species at any level, and generally there is a lack of research on abundance. Historical accounts suggest the species is uncommon, rarely observed and occurs at low densities (Philips 1981, Roberts 1977). In the Potohar Plateau, Pakistan, Irshad<em> et al.</em> (2015) estimated population density based on counts of active burrows between 2010 and 2013. Across the four districts studied estimated density declined by ~79% between 2010 and 2012 (Irshad <em>et al.</em> 2015), which has been attributed to illegal capture and killing for international trade in pangolin scales (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012). Similarly, in 2012 estimated densities comprised 0.37 ± 0.12 individuals/km² in Chakwal, 0.12 ± 0.08 individuals/km² in Jhelum, 0.10 ± 0.00 individuals/km² in Rawalpindi, and 0.33 ± 0.24 individuals/km² in Attock (Irshad <em>et al.</em> 2015). Using the same method, M<span>ahmood<em> et al.</em> (2015a) estimated an average density 0.36 individuals/km² in Margalla Hills National Park, and 0.00044 individuals/km² in Maneshra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2018). However, it should be noted that there are limitation to the methods used here; it can be inferred from other species of pangolin that this species likely uses multiple burrows in a very short period and as such these estimated should be treated with caution (see Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2019 for discussion on methods).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, <span lang=""EN-US"">Pabasara <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated population density at Yagirala Forest Reserve in the southwest of the country&#160; to be 5.69 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, based on modelling camera trap records without identification of individual animals (see Rowcliffe <em>et al.</em> 2008). This is potentially an underestimate based on known exploitation of populations in the area. These densities are far higher than anywhere else in the species’ range and may be due to habitat differences, i.e. tropical lowland rainforest supporting a broader and more abundant prey base. Overexploitation of populations by excessive hunting may have almost eliminated pangolins from some parts of the country (P. Perera, pers. comm).<br/></span></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are no quantitative population data available for India, Nepal or Bangladesh though it can be inferred and/or suspected that populations in each range state are in decline based on indiscriminate and apparently increasing rates of exploitation. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that between 2000 and 2018 around 300,000 Asian pangolins were trafficked internationally, though it is difficult to accurately quantify how much of this illegal trade involved the Indian Pangolin. <span lang=""EN-US"">T<span lang=""EN-US"">here are contemporary records of the species in various protected areas (see the Geographic Range setcion). Further research is needed to determine the status of populations in all range states, including Bangladesh, and the impact of exploitation for local use and international trafficking.&#160;</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in South Asia from northern and southeastern Pakistan through much of India south of the Himalayas (excluding far northeastern portions of the country), southern Nepal, and Sri Lanka (Prater 1971, Roberts 1977, Schlitter 2005, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). The species is likely to occur in northern and western Bangladesh (A. Ghose and S. Trageser, pers. comm.). Some reference works refer to the occurrence of the species in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, but there is no evidence to support this, and there are no records from Myanmar (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>This species is very locally distributed in Pakistan but has been recorded in all four provinces. In the north it has been recorded in Sialkot, Jhelum and Gujrat Districts in Punjab, extending across the Salt Range into Kohat District, and from Attock District (formerly known as Campbellpur) up to Mardan and Peshawar in the North West Frontier Province (Roberts 1977). There are also records from before 2009 in Nowshera and Swabi (F. Abbas, unpubl. data). It has also been found in the Potohar Plateau Range upwards into the Himalayan foothills (up to 750 m asl). This species is also present in the districts of Kotli, Mirpur and Bhimber in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (R. Hussain, unpubl. data). There are records of the species within the last five years from the Indus River floodplain, including the districts of Bhakar and Jhang (F. Abbas, unpubl. data). Further south there are records from the hilly regions in the western part of the Dadu and Larkana deserts (Sindh), extending southward through Las Bela and Mekran. It also occurs east of the Indus in Hyderabad district and Tharparkar, extending eastwards to Kutch (Roberts 1977).</p><p>Widely distributed in India from the Himalayan foothills to the far south, except the far northeast (Tikader, 1983).

The northeastern limits of distribution are not well understood. Choudhury (2001) reports that an individual was caught in Nagaon district, Assam in the 1990s. The is the eastern most record of the species, and it possibly occurs in Meghalaya (Agrawal <em>et al</em>. 1992). There is a record from Manas National Park (Goswami<span lang=""EN-US""> and Ganesh 2014) where the species appears to be sympatric with the Chinese Pangolin.

Recent distribution records suggest that the species is distributed in all nine provinces of the country, inhabiting environments up to 1,850 m asl, with occurrence records from Nuwara Eliya District (Perera <em>et al</em>. in prep). However, records from the coastal lowlands in Jaffna peninsula are rather scarce. This species has been recorded from all dry zone National Parks of Sri Lanka and&#160; has also been recorded from coastal and near shore areas.&#160;</p><p>This species is distributed in lowland areas of southern and western Nepal (Baral and Shah 2008), and is found in a number of protected areas (see the Conservation section).&#160;<span>Within Parsa Wildlife Reserve, it is possible the species is sympatric with the Chinese <span>P<span>angolin.

Throughout its range, the species' population has been heavily impacted by illegal collection for meat consumption and for its skin. Given that the area where it occurs coincides with the highest human population densities in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, habitat loss, degradation, and trade are major threats to the species. Overall, it is suspected that the population of the species has declined between 50–60% during the last three generations, and it is therefore listed as Endangered.","This species is found in a number of humid habitats, including riverbanks, canals and rice fields, but predominantly in marshland (Visser&#160;2004). It is absent from dry grassland or hot steppe, areas in which it has erroneously been assumed to occur (Visser 2004). It is mainly terrestrial, but is largely aquatic between June and October in the monsoon season (Visser 2004). In the dry season animals (between November and February) to its own burrows, termite mounds or crevices and cracks in the earth (Visser 2004). Its diet is known to include amphibian, reptile and bird eggs, insects and rodents (Visser 2004). They also are specialized for feeding on crabs. Animals of both sexes become sexually mature between their third and fourth year and females produce a single clutch (Visser 2004). Clutches of 4 to 30 eggs (mean 16) are laid in burrows in elevated areas between July and October (Visser 1985, Bennett 1988, Visser 2004). The length of the incubation period is 155 days at temperatures of &gt;30°, however, can last more to 250 days if temperatures are 30°C and less (Auliya and Koch 2020).<br/><br/>Sexual maturity in both males and females is estimated at 3.5 years (range 2.5–4 yrs )and longevity in captivity is 10.6 years (Schleich and Kastle 2002). Assuming that animals in the wild may live less than in captivity, nine years is used in the estimation of generation length. Using the formula: age of first reproduction + (z * length of reproductive period), generation length is estimated at 5.7 years [3.5 + (0.4 * 5.5)]","The Gangetic River basin where this species occurs coincides with the highest human population densities in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Throughout its range, the species is heavily exploited for its skin and meat. It is also used along with other monitor lizards in traditional medicine (Shah and Tiwari 2004). Recreational killing in combination with persecution is also a major threat in both India and Nepal (Das 1988, Ghimire and Shah 2014). In India, one of the popular ways of hunting this species is by using dogs (A. Das pers. comm. 2019). Juveniles of the species are often predated by subsidized predators, such as domestic cats (A.

In Bangladesh, agricultural activities are causing the degradation of breeding habitats (K. Hasan pers. comm. 2019). <br/><br/>It is frequently found in road kills (P. Mohapatra pers. comm. 2019). <br/><br/>The species is largely confined to marshy and wetland habitats, which are under severe pressure from encroachment, land filling, and pollution (A.

In Nepal it is restricted to small patches of habitat as a result of habitat encroachment, poaching and persecution (Karki and Bista 2008, Khatiwada and Ghimire 2009, Ghimire and Shah 2014).","There are no current data on population size and trends for this species. It is uncommon compared with the other monitor lizards in its range. The population is likely decreasing, mainly due to exploitation. In Bangladesh, the main reason for population decline is likely to be degradation of its breeding habitat.

Biju pers. comm. October 2011). It has been recorded within plantations (Biju and Bossuyt 2009). During the non-breeding season it can be found under leaf litter and logs in secondary vegetation, whereas during the breeding season it can be found on vegetation up to 1 m above the ground (Biju and Bossuyt 2009). It has been found on grasses and bushes in marshy grassland ecosystems, vayals and open grasslands, however, not a single encounter was observed in the surrounding evergreen forest patches, likely to be an indication that this species is a vayal specialist (Rajkumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). It is unlikely to tolerate habitat loss and disturbance (Rajkumar K.P.&#160;and R. Suyesh pers. comm. October 2020).

Biju pers. comm. October 2011, Rajkumar K.P.&#160;and R. Suyesh pers. comm. October 2020).

October 2020). Off-roading vehicles for tourism is a threat in Sathram (Rajkumar K.P.&#160;pers. comm. October 2020). Climate change is a potential future threat which may result in the shifting of habitat, and subpopulations that already exist in higher elevations may be lost as they have no habitat to migrate to (Rajkumar K.P.&#160;and R.

The species has a low extent of occurrence of approximately 47,000 km<sup>2</sup>, however only exists in a few locations (&lt;5) and has a restricted area of occupancy of approximately 48 km<sup>2</sup>. The species is also listed under Appendix II of CITES, and is internationally traded on account of its rarity in the wild. And despite existing in known sanctuaries and protected areas with protected status across the Bhutanese range, there is evidence of the species being subjected to habitat loss and habitat disturbance (due to agriculture, poaching, and climate change) across its range in Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh, India. There is also limited information on the population trends of this species. To safeguard the future population of this species therefore, further conservation planning is required. Improved monitoring of population trends and applying butterfly surveys could help further in maintaining the species population.","The Trashiyangtse Valley (where the species was recorded) runs north-to-south in the Eastern Himalayas, with elevations reaching over 5,000 m (Wangdi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<em>Aristolochia griffithii </em>is the primary foodplant for this species (Harada <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Bhutan, this plant occurs in montane regions (1,800-3,000 m), surrounded by cooler broadleaved forests (including a mixture of evergreen oak and mixed fir) (Harada <em>et al</em>. 2012). The host plant is an evergreen woody climber (Harada <em>et al</em>. 2012). The elevation occupied by this species exhibits alpine conditions (that also stretch to the lower foothills of the Himalayas), with hardwood forests also dominating the area (FAO/UNEP 1981). Blue pine and deciduous forests are also be found within the area (FAO/UNEP 1981, Harada <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Although early recordings showed the species to occur in gaps along primary forests in Bhutan, secondary forests now dominate the valley and are therefore the primary habitat of this species (Harada <em>et al</em>. 2012). Across its occurrence in Arunachal Pradesh, the habitat is mostly mountainous, containing tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous, pine, temperate, and alpine forests (Department of Environment and Forest 2018).

Although Bhutan is one of the best forested areas within the Himalayan mountain region, resources have been eroded due to unregulated grazing, forest fires, and high consumption of wood (used for fuel and construction) (Collins and Morris 1985). Other threats to the species include conversion of habitat to arable land (with forest degradation thought to occur in over 80% of forest area) and climate change (due to its land-locked nature and physical topography) (National Environment Commission 2016).&#160;Wildlife could therefore be affected, with the effects thought to be unrecoverable due to the nature and topography of the Himalayan region (Collins and Morris 1985). However, approximately 2.8 million hectares (out of a land area of 3.8 million ha) is covered by forest, with forest loss (with 30% canopy density) only accounting for 22,800 hectares between 2001-2017 (Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;The future of the species is also thought to be affected by poachers (Harada <em>et al</em>. 2012), following its rediscovery and known rarity. Across the state of Arunachal Pradesh, similar threats have been reported, for example, due to growing populations, livestock farming, infrastructure construction, conversion of forests to developed areas and low awareness of forestry (Department of Environment and Forest 2018).","The species is thought to be rare and uncommon (Singh and Chib 2015, Sondhi and Kunte 2016).

Conservation measures already established could therefore be a significant contributor towards minimal tree loss.<br/><br/>Past status assessments, at times when the species had not yet been rediscovered, concluded that the presence of the species within the Trashiyangsi Valley needed to be reconfirmed (Collins and Morris 1985). Although now rediscovered in the valley, additional surveys are required to establish whether the species occurs at other loaclities in the Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh, India.

The exploitation of the species appears to be particularly high in Cambodia with researchers reporting no <em>N. bengalensis </em>present at most sites (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The release of slow lorises confiscated from the illegal pet trade with little or no rehabilitation is a threat to all slow loris species, as is translocation from human-dominated landscapes into forests, to which individuals of the species may not be adapted (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2014, Starr and Nekaris 2015).

Hunters in this area also reported seeing them during shifting cultivation. A captive Bengal slow loris was recorded in Phimaw Internally Displaced Person’s camp in February - March 2013 that was reported to come from the local area. According to local people, slow lorises are rarely seen in this area and are not easy to find. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, no specific nation-wide population survey on this species has been carried out, but a 2015 survey team encountered 34 Bengal slow lorises (18-night survey) in Satchari National Park of Sylhet division. A one-night survey in Lawachara National Park revealed three individuals (S.C. Rahman, pers. comm). The species was also recorded in Rema-Kalenga&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Feeroz <em>et al</em>, 2011) and Rajkandi Reserve Forest of Sylhet area (M. Foysal, T. Khan, pers.comm). Feeroz (2013) reported <em>N. bengalensis </em>as being rare in Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary of Chittagong region. All of these forests are semi- evergreen. A photography record is available from Kaptai National Park, Rangamati Hill District under Chittagong division (S.R. Rahul, pers. comm.). Beside these records, since 2010, several Bengal Slow Lorises were taken from human habitation in Jamalpur, Sherpur and Mymensingh district. These districts have some deciduous forests and are connected with Meghalaya state of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan Choudhury (2008) reports that Bengal slow loris habitat is mostly tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in the foothills up to 300 m. The species has been indirectly recorded in the possession of woodcutters in four dzongkhags including Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkar, Sarpang and Zemgang. From this, Choudhury inferred that they should occur in Royal Manas National Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Wangchuk&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004) wrote that lorises also occur in Chukha and Samchi districts, but did not say on what evidence. The existing records indicate that the Sankosh River is the western limit for the species in Bhutan as well as Assam.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, some researchers report the population to occur potentially in large forest tracts (R. Timmins pers. comm). Duckworth (1994) and Ratajszczak (1998), however, both reported the species as being very rare in Lao PDR, with the former reporting abundance indices of about 0.30-0.65/km at sites including: Central Laos (Phou Xang He, NakaiNam Theun, Xe Piang, Muang Hom, Nam Kading, Nam Ao, Bang Navang) and South Laos (Xe Namoy). In 2000, published data from 1994-1995 recorded <em>N. bengalensis </em>frequency as “common” in some forests (Phou Khaokhoay NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, and Bolavens Northeast PPA), whereas they were encountered “occasional” in others (Nakai Plateau) (Evans, et al., 2000, Streicher, 2014). A single record comes from Southern Laos in Xe Kaman lowlands in Dong Ampham NBCA, Attapu Province&#160; (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the populations are severely reduced and have disappeared from many forests (Fitch-Snyder and Thanh 2002; V. Thanh pers. comm). Surveys carried out in northern Viet Nam at Na Hang Nature Reserve in 2013 recorded a density of 0.09 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data). Recent surveys of N. bengalensis in Central Vietnam at Bach Ma National Park returned no animals in 30.4 km of surveys (Blair, unpublished data). A large population with a phenotype of the Cambodian forms occurs on Phu Quoc island in the Gulf of Thailand (Huaong and Blair, pers. comm). Surveys in 2014 in Phu Quoc Island recorded a density of 0.38 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Cambodia the species is very rare and has only been seen west of the Mekong River in Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Kulen National Park at 22.5-25.0 animals per km2 (Starr et al., 2010). Observations of recently hunted animals were made in Preah Vihear Protection Forest, Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Tbeng (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2011). Starr <em>et al</em>. (2010) failed to detect this species in Bokor National Park and Cardamoms Protected Forest; they also did not detect it east of the Mekong (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri PF); Coudrat et al. also could not find this species east of the Mekong at the following sites: Mondulkiri (Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Pritch Wildlife Sanctuary) or Ratanakiri (Vonsei District, Virachey National Park, Seima Protection Forest, Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary). Other surveyors in Cambodia have noted the presence of the species in a number of community forests (Eam Sam Un, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Bengal slow loris is thought to be widespread (W. Brockelman pers. comm.) but has never been surveyed specifically.&#160; It is known from Khao Yai National Park. Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. (2010) found that the species is absent from many forests, and occurs at very low densities when present. In plantation forest in Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, they recorded Bengal slow lories at a density of 0.64 individuals/km (Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>In China, surveys have been carried out since 2013. Bengal Slow Loris habitat is mostly primary evergreen broad-leaf forest up to 2,200 m. The population occurs in counties of western and southwestern Yunnan (Yingjiang, Longchuan, Ruili, Tengchong, Mangshi, Zhenkang, Cangyuan, Gengma, Yongde, Shuangjiang, Ximeng, Lancang, Menglian, Menghai, Mengla), even in secondary forests and agricultural plantations (Ni, pers. comm.). Survey in Cangyuan recorded a density of 0.33 individuals/km (Ni, unpublished data). In southern and southeastern Yunnan, Bengal slow loris is mostly distributed in scattered nature reserves as follows: Yuanjiang, Amushan, Guanyinshan, Huanglianshan, Fenshuiling, Daweishan, Laojunshan, Gulinqing, Laoshan. The populations are severely reduced and have possibly disappeared from southwest of Guangxi Province (Ni, per. comm.).

The majority of its range lies outside Europe where it was not thought to be declining at a sufficiently rapid rate to approach the threshold for Vulnerable. However recent information suggests that the population outside Europe may be exposed to greater threats than was previously thought and has also undergone very rapid recent declines across much of the range. It is therefore classified as Endangered.<p></p>,"It inhabits areas of steppe and semi-desert, and is recorded breeding up to 2,300 m in mountainous regions (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;It feeds mainly on small mammals on its breeding grounds, with susliks forming the vast majority of its diet in some areas; when wintering it appears to feed mainly on mole rats in East Africa, and termites and Red-billed Quelea&#160;<em>Quelea quelea</em>&#160;predominate in southern Africa (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;Nests have traditionally been built as large platforms on the ground, although recent habitat alterations seem to have caused a shift to building a few metres higher in bushes or trees (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). It also nests on artificial structures and will occur on rubbish grounds and waste sites (Keijmel 2019).&#160;The species is migratory, with birds wintering in south-east Africa and southern Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrants leave their breeding grounds between August and October/November, returning between January and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Subedi 2014). It avoids sea crossings and thus forms large concentrations at bottleneck sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","The species has declined in the west of its breeding range, including extirpation from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, as a result of the conversion of steppes to agricultural land combined with direct persecution (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Boesman 2013).&#160;It is also adversely affected by power lines and is very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (STRIX 2012, Meyburg and Boesman 2013). It was recently found to be the raptor most frequently electrocuted by power lines in a study in western Kazakhstan (Levin and Kurkin 2013) and in Saudi Arabia (Shobrak <em>et al. </em>2021). Three sets of factors have been identified as having detrimental impacts on the species in Russia and Kazakhstan: increased mortality owing to collisions with power lines, pesticide poisoning and direct persecution; a reduction in the area of suitable habitat and availability of food, historically due to overgrazing but now due to undergrazing, and to a lesser extent logging and mining; poor breeding success owing to destruction of nests and juvenile mortality during spring fires, entanglement of nestlings in artificial nest materials, and disturbance by people and livestock (Strategy of the Steppe Eagle Conservation in the Russian Federation 2016). Young eagles are taken out of the nest in order to sell them to western European countries (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). Recent studies using social media to assess impacts on wildlife found that the species was also being illegally killed in Jordan, of which the species is legally protected in the country (Eid and Handal 2018). A decline in the number of birds and a reduction in the proportion of juveniles migrating over Eilat, Israel began immediately after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, leading Yosef and Fornadari (2004) to suggest that the species may have been affected by radioactive contamination.

4997,214862019,15955,Panthera tigris,Endangered,A2abcd,2022,2021-12-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Tiger is listed as Endangered under criterion A2abcd. Based on the evidence of Tiger population and/or range declines across the 30-year assessment period (upper bound of GL (7-10 years)) in at least nine of the 13 countries, which had extant Tiger subpopulations at the beginning of the assessment period, we applied a conservative precautionary approach to the assessment. However, we recognize that there are several uncertainties (see below) in the available data from the past and that the classification of Endangered as opposed to Vulnerable is marginal.<br/><br/>There are only two population estimates available that may be used as baselines for estimating population changes over the past three generations (21–30 years): 1) in 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999) and 2) in 1996, Nowell and Jackson (1996) estimated global Tiger numbers at 8,262 (based on a summation of their regional estimates). Based on the most recent national estimates (see Supplementary Information), the global Tiger population numbers between 3,726 and 5,578 individuals and is restricted to ten countries. Assuming that, on average, 70% of Tigers in a subpopulation are mature (see Supplementary Information), this provides a best estimate of 3,140 (2,608–3,905) mature individuals. Comparing the numbers of Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> (1999) to the upper and lower bounds of the current population estimate results in estimated population declines ranging from 22% to 63%. Based on these results, the Tiger qualifies for a range of possible Red List Categories from Near Threatened to Endangered applying criterion A2ab (see Supplementary Information). Comparing the estimate of Nowell and Jackson (1996) to the upper and lower bound of the current population estimate results in population declines ranging from 53% to 68%, classifying the Tiger as Endangered under criterion A2ab in all cases (see Supplementary Information). Based on these analyses, we classify Tigers as Endangered under criterion A2ab for several reasons: 1) of the nine possible outcomes from these comparisons, five result in assessing Tigers as Endangered (see Supplementary Information), 2) a precautionary approach is warranted given the severe, ongoing threats to Tigers and their extirpation from several countries since the turn of the century (see below and Supplementary Information), 3) a precautionary approach is recommended by the IUCN Guidelines and, 4) even if the lower bound of the estimated population decline would be applied, the IUCN’s five-year rule would only allow moving a taxon from a Category of higher threat to a Category of lower threat if none of the Criteria of the higher Category has been met for five years, which is highly unlikely for the Tiger.<br/><br/>Comparing Seidensticker’s e<em>t al. </em>(1999) estimate and Nowell and Jackson’s (1996) estimate with the current estimated population size in 2021 results in applied generation lengths of 7.7 years and 8.3 years respectively, both of which fall within the estimated range of the estimated Generation Length of 7–10 years (see Population section). The calculations over 7 or 10 years would not change the decline significantly to change the listing of the Tiger as Endangered. Moreover, information on trends in global Tiger numbers in the 1990s are insufficient to justify linear or exponential extrapolation of the global population to explore the full range of the 7- to 10-year generation length.<br/><br/>Evidence indicates that Tigers have undergone a range contraction of &gt;50% over the past three generations leading to a suspected population reduction of &gt;50%, thereby satisfying subcriterion A2c. In 1994, Dinerstein <em>et al. </em>(1997) estimated to total 1.64 million km² in 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations, not including Russia (later estimated at 270,0000 km², making the total 1,910,000 km² (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006)) and China. This exercise was revised and updated ten years later, when the occupied Tiger range was estimated at 1.1 million km² in 74 Tiger Conservation Landscapes (roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations; Sanderson<em> et al. </em>2006). The TCL analysis was conducted again in 2021 (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> in prep.) when the occupied range was 978,293 km², a 54% decline since 1994 and a 7% decline since 2001. That there are currently between 654,254 and 1,030,027 km² of unoccupied Tiger habitat (includes 654,254 km² of Restoration Landscapes and 375,773 km² of Survey Landscapes (Sanderson in prep.) is testament to the severity of poaching of Tigers and their prey and recent local extinctions in Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR are directly attributed to poaching (Sanderson <em>et al. </em>2006, O’Kelly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Johnson<em> et al.</em> 2016). Based on this, we infer a &gt;50% population reduction over the past three generations, thereby satisfying subcriterion A2d.<br/><br/>Declines over the past three generations are largely due to poaching and habitat loss. Both threats continue throughout the Tiger range; hence, criterion A1 was dismissed (Walston <em>et al. </em>2010; Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006 and in prep.; Robinson <em>et al. </em>2015). Criteria A3 and A4 were also dismissed because future trends are unclear. In parts of the Tiger’s range, Tigers have more recently been protected from these threats well enough to stabilize or even increase Tiger numbers (e.g., some protected areas in India, Nepal, Thailand, and NE Asia; Dhakal <em>et al. </em>2014, Duangchantrasiri <em>et al</em>. 2016, Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, in other areas, such as most of Southeast Asia, Tiger numbers continue to decline (Walston<em> et al.</em> 2010, Raspone<em> et al. </em>2019). These regional trends are expected to continue, with some gains in South and possibly Northeast Asia and further declines in Southeast Asia. Gains in South Asia with high Tiger densities may well offset losses in Southeast Asia, resulting in an increasing future trend in global Tiger numbers.<br/><br/>Seidensticker <em>et al. </em>(1999) and Nowell and Jackson (1996) did not specify whether the estimate of 5,000–7,000 and 8,262 Tigers, respectively, reflected all cohorts or only mature individuals. Still, given the low quantity and quality of data available at the time, it is likely that it included all cohorts except, perhaps, cubs, which are not normally included in population estimates. If that were the case, the estimate of mature individuals would have been lower, possibly representing &lt;50% decline needed to qualify as Endangered. Neither of these two estimates from the 1990s were based on significant field surveys where population density was estimated or modelled from known densities, and hence caution has to be taken when estimating population trends. Nevertheless, they are the only most accurate available estimates to compare the current estimated population size to. Moreover, the decline in Tiger occupancy of &gt;50% may not represent a &gt;50% population decline because the decline was predominantly in Southeast Asia, where Tiger densities and subpopulations are relatively low. The low Tiger subpopulations in Southeast Asia, even at the start of the assessment period, means that their contribution to the overall range-wide decline of Tiger numbers may be relatively small. However, given intense pressures on Tiger subpopulations from poaching and habitat loss, the extirpation of Tigers from Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR since the turn of the century, and vast tracts of habitats across the species range, including regions in South Asia where the species is still sparsely distributed, or entirely absent, we believe a conservative, precautionary approach is warranted.<br/><br/>We provide the first reasonably rigorous estimate of global Tiger numbers, based largely on capture-recapture and occupancy methodologies (see Supplementary Information). This is particularly true for South Asia range states, which make up 76% of the global population. As such, it sets a realistic baseline for future Red List evaluations.&#160; We caution the use of previous Red List estimates as a basis of comparison because of the lack of scientific rigour and poor range-wide sampling coverage. For example, the estimate of mature individuals (2,154 Tigers) from Walston <em>et al. </em>(2010) used in the 2011 and 2015 IUCN Red List Assessments of Tigers is very likely an underestimate of the number of mature individuals because it included only protected areas large enough to contain 75 adult Tigers, and hence, excluded many smaller protected areas known to contain mature, breeding Tigers. Further, many protected areas that were subsequently surveyed were not included in this analysis. Hence, this estimate was not and will not be appropriate as a baseline for comparison for future Red List Assessments.</p>","<p>Extant Tiger subpopulations occur in the tropical, subtropical and  temperate forests of South and Southeast Asia and the temperate  evergreen forests of Palaearctic realms in Russia and China. Tigers are  habitat generalists, and have adapted to diverse habitats inclusive of  equatorial rainforests and mangroves in India and Sumatra, semi-arid  habitats of western India, Himalayan deciduous and evergreen forests up  to elevations of about 4,500 m and temperate forests in northeast Russia  and China.<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large  ungulates is the Tiger's primary habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and  deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of  the Tiger's diet, and in general Tigers require a good population of  these species to survive and reproduce"" (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Tigers need to kill 50–60 large prey animals per year (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2004, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2012, Miller <em>et al.</em>  2013). However, when large prey populations are depleted they  opportunistically predate on sub-optimal prey such as birds, fish,  rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles, and other mammals such as  primates and porcupines. Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger  than themselves, including large bovids (Water Buffalo, Gaur, Banteng),  and rarely even Asian Elephants and rhinos. However, like many large  carnivores, preferred prey essential for successful reproduction are  species that are approximately the same weight as Tigers themselves  (Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with  adults maintaining exclusive territories or home ranges. Adult female  home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap with  1–3 females, a typical pattern of social organisation among solitary  felids. Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant; e.g.,  female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far  East, they are much larger at about 400 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002,  Goodrich <em>et al.</em> 2010). Similarly, reported Tiger densities range  from a maximum of 15–19 Tigers per 100 km² where prey is abundant  (India's Kaziranga and Corbett National Parks) to as low as 0.13–0.45  per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's  Sikhote Alin Mountains (Soutyrina <em>et al.</em> 2013, Matiukhina <em>et al.</em> 2016, Jhala <em>et al.</em>  2020). In general, Tiger densities are higher in alluvial flood plains  and tropical deciduous forests than tropical moist, evergreen forests of South and Southeast Asia and temperate habitats of far East Asia.<br/><br/>Tigers  occur at their highest densities in protected areas with a long  management history for the species, which attests to how habitats  relatively free of anthropogenic pressure can serve as vital source  sites. Yet, the relationship between human disturbance and Tigers is  complex, with breeding subpopulations sometimes persisting at relatively  high densities in areas subject to pressures including grazing, logging  and extracting non-timber forest products (Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2008, Rayan and Mohamad. 2009, Jhala <em>et al.</em>  2020). In addition, there are breeding Tiger subpopulations that may  co-occur quite extensively with people. It is, however, likely that  Tiger population dynamics are more unstable in such areas and that  survival across age classes is lower as a function of reduced  availability of secure habitats. These aspects of how Tiger subpopulations  have adapted to human-dominated landscapes merit greater attention,  given that most potential Tiger habitats lie outside of protected areas  and that many such sites may have significant recovery potential. A  related aspect pertains to how Tiger subpopulations can adapt to use  human-created habitats (such as sugarcane and oil palm plantations) that  resemble or have replaced natural habitats, particularly when such  areas also support wild ungulates (Warrier <em>et al.</em> 2020). Such  behavioural adaptations have important implications for this species'  ability to persist in the face of stressors such as habitat  fragmentation, land-use change and climate impacts on habitats and will  often result in increased human-Tiger conflict.</p>","<p>Hunting of Tigers and their prey has been the main driver of Tiger  population declines during the assessment period (i.e., since 1991).  Poaching for illegal trade in high-value Tiger products including skins,  bones, meat, and tonics, is a primary threat to Tigers, which, along  with prey depletion, has led to their recent disappearance from broad  areas of otherwise suitable habitat and continues at unsustainable  rates. Tiger occupancy has declined 53% since 1997 (Dinerstien <em>et al.</em> 1997) and 20% since 2005 (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>  2006 and in prep.), with the decline largely attributed to poaching,  though habitat loss has also been considerable during that period. That  there are roughly one million square kilometres of unoccupied Tiger  habitat (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006) is a clear indication that poaching of Tiger and prey is the greatest threat to Tigers range-wide (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2008). Poaching was identified as the primary cause of mortality for Tigers in Russia (Goodrich <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kerley <em>et al.</em>  2002). The loss of Tigers in Lao PDR during the assessment period also  appeared to be driven by targeted poaching of Tigers (Rasphone <em>et al.</em>  2019). Hunting is particularly significant in Southeast Asia, where  intense snaring and poisoning have driven declines in Tigers and their  prey (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2010; Johnson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017a, 2018). Tigers are particularly susceptible to illegal transnational trade (Oswell 2010, Stoner and Pervushina 2013, Hossain <em>et al.</em> 2018, Wong and Krishnaswamy 2019).<br/><br/>Asia  is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge  pressures to bear on the large areas of habitat required for viable  Tiger subpopulations. The main drivers of Tiger habitat loss and  fragmentation are conversion of forest land to agriculture and  silviculture, commercial logging, human settlement, and linear  infrastructure development are the main drivers of Tiger habitat loss  and fragmentation. With their substantial dietary requirements, Tigers  require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also  under heavy human hunting pressure and competition from domestic  livestock.<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation driven by linear infrastructure  development, land-use change, and urbanization can drive the extinction  of Tiger subpopulations (e.g., Mondal and Nagendra 2011, Joshi <em>et al.</em>  2016). Tigers can become locally or functionally extinct in areas where  habitat connectivity is severed or severely compromised (Gopal <em>et al.</em> 2010; Harihar <em>et al.</em>  2018b, 2020). Land-use change simulations coupled with connectivity  analysis using Tiger genetic data from Central India has established  that genetic variability (heterozygosity) will decrease in the future,  greatly elevating extinction risks for small and isolated subpopulations  (Thatte <em>et al.</em> 2018). Such effects may be mitigated to an extent  by regulating development and land-use change around reserves, and human  activity in areas already developed (e.g., along roads). Other recent  research also outlines how fragmentation and isolation can lead to  inbreeding depression and atypical phenotypic variation in Tiger subpopulations (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021, Sagar <em>et al.</em> 2021). While  evidence for fragmentation impacts of habitat fragmentation on Tiger and  wild prey populations and movements is growing, Tiger conservation  landscapes continue to be transformed by linear infrastructure and other  threats at unprecedented rates across Tiger range states (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2020, Jayadevan <em>et al.</em> 2020, Palmeirin and Gibson 2021).<br/><br/>Tiger  attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of Tigers by  neighbouring communities and present an ongoing challenge to managers to  build local support for Tiger conservation and lead to high rates of  retaliatory killing of Tigers (Goodrich 2010, Miquelle <em>et al.</em>  2005). In some areas, there have been many human deaths − for example,  at least 40 people were killed by Tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove  forest of Bangladesh and India in 2000−2010 (Barlow <em>et al.</em> 2013),  and 320 people were killed in India from 2014 to 2020 (Manoj 2021). The  retaliatory killing of Tigers in response to attacks on people and  livestock is common and  often assumed to be a significant cause of  population decline, but this has never been systematically recorded.<br/><br/>Infectious  disease in Tigers has been little studied and is poorly understood, but  several Tiger deaths have been attributed to canine distemper virus  infection, including a significant loss of Tigers from Sikhote-Alin  Zapovednik in Russia (Quigley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Goodrich <em>et al.</em> 2012, Seimon <em>et al.</em>  2013, Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Disease can also impact Tiger prey, e.g. African Swine Fever is a  significant concern in Russia and Indonesia and will likely spread  throughout the Tiger range (Luskin <em>et al.</em> 2021).&#160;</p>","The Tiger population estimate of between 3,726 and 5,578 individuals (not  including cubs; see Assessment Rationale and Supplementary Information)  is the first reasonably rigorous estimate of global Tiger numbers, based  largely on capture-recapture and occupancy methodologies. Based on IUCN  definitions of mature individuals (which we estimate at comprising ~70%  of the camera-trapped population of Tigers; see Supplementary  Information), this gives an estimated range of between 2,608 and 3,905 mature  individuals, with a best estimate of 3,140.<br/><br/>However, there is considerable variation among  countries in the methods used to calculate the estimate, the time  period for which the estimate refers to, and potential double-counting of  individuals in transboundary subpopulations. For example, the population  estimate for Bhutan was based on surveys conducted in 2014 (DoFPS 2015),  and our estimate for Indonesia was based on data collected between 2004  and 2018 and using estimated forest cover from 2017. Updated national  population estimates, using similar methodologies to those in published  studies (DoFPS 2015, DNPWC and DFSC 2018, Aziz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019,&#160;Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2020) are expected from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Russia in 2022 based on field-surveys conducted since 2021.<br/><br/>We  believe our population estimate sets the first realistic baseline for  future Red List (re-) assessments and other evaluations, but we caution  the use of previous global estimates as a basis of comparison because of  the lack of scientific rigour and poor range-wide sampling coverage.&#160;However, these estimates (Seidenstricker <em>et al.</em> 1999, and Nowell and Jackson 1998) are the only available estimates to compare the current population estimate to, to estimate the population trend in the past. Nevertheless, for example, the estimate of mature individuals (2,154 Tigers) from Walston <em>et al. </em>(2010) used in the 2011 and 2015 IUCN Red List Assessments of Tigers is very likely an underestimate of the number of mature individuals because many protected areas were not included in the analysis (see Rationale; Chundawat<em> et al. </em>2011, Goodrich <em>et al.</em> 2015). Therefore, this estimate has not been used for estimating past population declines. Hence, our estimate can by no means be interpreted as an increase over previous Red List Assessments. Rather, it is a complete counting using more reliable methodologies. Furthermore, while Tiger numbers have increased in some sites, particularly in India and Nepal (e.g., Western Ghats, India, Central India, and Terai Arc Landscape across India and Nepal), they have also declined in key areas, especially in mainland SE Asia, e.g., Lao PDR has lost its Tigers since the last Assessment in 2015 and Tigers appear to be in steep decline in Malaysia (Dhakal <em>et al.</em> 2014,&#160; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012, Duangchantrasiri<em> et al. </em>2016, Johnson<em> et al.</em> 2016, Harihar <em>et al. </em>2020, Jhala<em> et al.</em> 2020; see also Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Currently,  the governments of India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Indonesia have  implemented rigorous and regular monitoring to estimate country-wide  abundance or occupancy (Indonesia). However, because methodologies  change over time and are focused on estimating abundance rather than  trends, it is difficult to elucidate temporal trends from the results  (see Supplementary Information). Other countries have yet to implement  rigorous methodologies at the country scale. However, all countries  have long-term monitoring to estimate density in some protected areas  and Indonesia has conducted two island-wide occupancy surveys on Sumatra  that were key to estimating island-wide abundance (see Supplementary  Information). Moving forward, countries must standardize their  country-wide estimates in a way that focuses on accurate and precise  measurement of temporal and spatial trends.<p></p>",Decreasing,"Tigers once inhabited a wide range of countries in Asia, spanning from  Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia, and from the  Indonesian islands of Java and Bali in the south to 55°N latitude in the  far east of Russia  (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> in prep.). Over the past 100  years, Tigers have disappeared from Singapore (1930s), Bali (1940s),  Java and Hong Kong (1960s), central Asia (1970s), most of the mainland  temperate (1980s) and tropical (1990s) China, and more recently from  the Southeast Asian countries of Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia (2000s)  (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> in prep.). Tigers now occupy less than 7% of  their historical range, with a 7% decrease from 1,049,430 km² in 2001 to  978,293 km² in 2020. Breeding subpopulations of Tigers presently  are confirmed in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, and Thailand. Tigers are confirmed in Myanmar,  but southern and eastern Myanmar subpopulations are likely dependent on  immigration from Thailand.<br/><br/>In 1994, the first comprehensive assessment to delineate the Tiger range was conducted (Wikramanayake <em>et al.</em>  1998). Priority areas for Tiger conservation were estimated to total  1.64 million km² in 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), roughly  equivalent to discrete meta-populations, not including Russia and China  (later estimated at 270,0000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al.</em> (2006)). In  general, this was considered representative of current distribution, but Tigers were only found in 47% of the TCUs, and 89% were scored as  experiencing medium to high levels of poaching of Tigers and prey.<br/><br/>This  exercise was revised and updated ten years later. In delineating Tiger  Conservation Landscapes (TCLs), greater emphasis was placed on actual  Tiger presence and breeding (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006). Tiger  Conservation Landscapes were  defined as areas with sufficient habitat to conserve at least five  Tigers and areas where Tigers have been confirmed to exist in the past  decade. Tiger range was estimated at 1.1 million km² in 76 TCLs (roughly  equivalent to discrete meta-populations). This represented a 41%  decline from the area described a decade earlier (in South and Southeast  Asia, a drop from 1.55 million km² to 914,000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al.</em> (2006)), attributed this primarily to poaching pressure (Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> 2007). Deforestation has also caused habitat loss, particularly in Sumatra and Myanmar (Wikramanayake <em>et al.</em> 2011, Joshi <em>et al.</em>  2016). However, this apparent decline is also due to more refined  information. For instance, landscapes with Tigers in India were much  smaller and more fragmented than previously estimated by Sanderson <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2006).&#160;The Tiger Conservation Landscapes are currently being revised (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. in prep.: TCL V3). The current assessment identifies 71 Tiger Conservation Landscapes based on data from 2020 (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> in prep.: TCL V3). A review of TCLs highlighted that only 21% of the area is legally protected. However, only about 9% of the TCL area was protected in IUCN Categories I or II (defined as ‘strictly protected areas’). Management effectiveness (based on METT scores for a sub-set of protected areas) was generally poor in the protected areas due to widespread regulatory, budgetary, and enforcement constraints, and hunting was cited as the main threat. Furthermore, some TCLs are designated concessions for resource extraction (timber, plantations, oil, minerals, etc.; Forrest <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>In 2010, Walston <em>et al.</em>  identified 42 Source Sites across the Tiger range. Source Sites were  defined as areas with the confirmed presence of Tigers and evidence of  breeding, population estimates of &gt;25 breeding females, legal  protection, and embedded in a larger habitat landscape with the  potential to hold &gt;50 breeding females. Since the publication, Tigers  have been extirpated from the only Source Site in Lao PDR (Rasphone <em>et al.</em> 2019), and several others were also identified as supporting fewer Tigers than previously estimated (Harihar <em>et al.</em> 2018a). Some areas that meet Walston <em>et al.</em>’s (2010) criteria but were previously not identified as source sites have also  been documented, especially in South Asia. As more information on Tiger subpopulations emerges, there is a need to reassess source sites globally,  for example, while Bhutan was initially listed as a country that did not  contain any source sites, breeding subpopulations within protected areas  have been documented there over the past decade. Globally, over 60% of  Tiger subpopulations likely occur within protected areas. About 65% of India’s  estimated 2,967 Tigers occur in Tiger reserves, highlighting the  importance of source sites (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2020). Even as  conservation efforts continue to be prioritized in these vital source  sites, there is increasing evidence of the relevance of habitats beyond  protected area boundaries that also hold the potential to support breeding source subpopulations or have immense recovery potential in addition to being  critical corridors to connect source subpopulations (Chanchani <em>et al.</em> 2016, Thapa and Kelly 2017, Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2020, Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>While  coarse-scale data on Tiger occurrence is increasingly available across  most areas where the species is extant, there are still some significant  data gaps on Tiger occurrence at finer spatial scales, particularly in  some remote and sparsely populated regions of SE Asia and the Himalaya  of India, Nepal and Bhutan. Cumulatively, these areas may span several  hundred thousand kilometres of habitat – where information on  occurrence, subpopulations and breeding status is sparse. It is likely that  Tiger subpopulations currently only occur in low densities in these  habitats, but there may be significant recovery potential or accommodate  range shifts due to climate change.<br/><br/>The indigenous range of the Tiger has been determined by examining an extensive database of current and historical records of species occurrence (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. in prep.) and intersecting them with Dinerstein <em>et al</em>.'s (2017) ecoregional boundaries. Accordingly, the ecoregions which currently support, or once supported, breeding subpopulations have been identified as the indigenous range. As part of the revision of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. in prep.), an analysis of the available habitats within the indigenous range was conducted using information from recent surveys and Tiger records.&#160;As a result of this analysis, two broad range types have been identified: (1) extant ranges, where Tiger presence has been detected as of 2020; and (2) presence uncertain, where surveys have not been conducted or are insufficient to determine whether Tigers exist. We have classified all parts of the indigenous range that do not qualify as extant or presence uncertain as extinct for this assessment.<br/><br/>Please see Supplementary Information for details of distribution by range state.<p></p>","All Tiger subspecies have been listed in Appendix I of the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora  (CITES) since 1975 (except for Amur Tiger, <em>Panthera tigris altaica</em>, which was added to  Appendix I in 1987). Effectively this means that all international  commercial trade in Tigers, their parts, products and derivatives, has  long been prohibited. However, in parts of the range, Tiger trade occurs  in non-government controlled areas (e.g., northern Myanmar bordering  China), and implementing effective enforcement of laws and regulations is  complicated (Oswell 2010). Also, there are deep-rooted cultural  practices of consuming Tiger body parts in many countries where Tigers  occur in South and Southeast Asia (Verheji <em>et al.</em> 2010, Stoner and Pervushina 2013, Wong and Krishnaswamy 2019).<br/><br/>A Tiger skin could be sold in India for USD 1,500, and in China for USD 16,000 more than ten years ago (Loveridge <em>et al.</em> 2010). All parts of Tiger can be traded for USD 10,000−70,000 (Damania <em>et al.</em> 2008). Tiger poachers, however, earned at most USD 100–200 (Loveridge <em>et al.</em>  2010). Tiger wine is sold in East and Southeast Asia at USD 80−1,000 per  bottle depending on age and prestige (UNODC 2020). Tiger glue bars of  100 g are sold in Viet Nam for USD 1,000 (UNODC 2020). Tiger products were  found for sale in 2005−2006 at costs of (average per gram, prices in  CNY): raw Tiger bone 53.3 CNY, Tiger bone gel 3.6 CNY, Tiger bone wine  150 CNY. In wholesale markets, Tiger bone was sold for 10 CNY/g (Nowell  and Xu 2007). Tiger skin chubas (traditional cloaks) were found for sale  at an average price of 16,666 CNY (USD 3,370) in 2006 (Nowell and Xu  2007).<br/><br/>Skins, claws and canines are prestige display items for  elite members of society. It had been reported anecdotally from  Indonesia and Nepal that Tiger skins, in particular, were given as gifts  to high-ranking police and military officers by junior officers seeking  promotion. Similarly, specimens mounted using professional taxidermy  were restricted to wealthy and politically powerful individuals.  However, these practices are believed to have declined, and skin  possession, in general, was assessed to have reduced due to the ease of  detection and risks of transporting and displaying the items.  Nevertheless, Tiger skins are still traded and worn in western China and  Tibet (Wong 2015).<br/><br/>Bones, meat, and organs are believed to have  healing properties for different ailments in Traditional Chinese  Medicine, even whiskers, urine and scats (Stoner 2012). During the  COVID-19 pandemic, Tiger products were advertised for their properties  in protecting the owner against infection (Banks 2020). Belief in the  healing properties of body parts blends with belief in  spiritual/shamanistic healing powers in Bangladesh (Saif <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, 2018). Canines and claws are worn for prestige and jewellery in  some places; in parts of Thailand, they are spiritual amulets protecting  the wearer. A similar belief has been recorded in Bangladesh, with  forest users believing a morsel of Tiger bone will protect them from  attack (Saif <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2018). Elsewhere across the Tiger’s  range, the trade and use of body parts for occult practices, talismans  and medicine have also come to light through seizures.<br/><br/>Within  Viet Nam and China, demand for Tiger products is high. The rising  affluence of consumers across the region has increased the consumption  of Tiger products (Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2018, TRAFFIC 2019). In Viet  Nam, research conducted in 2017 suggested consumption rates as high as  11% of the population in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh cities (Davis <em>et al.</em>  2020), while in China, a 2007 TRAFFIC survey reported declining  availability of Tiger products in Traditional Chinese Medicine (Nowell  and Xu 2007). <br/><br/>In both Viet Nam and China, Tiger bone is made  into a ‘tonic’, with a preference for whole bones steeped in alcohol in  China, whereas in Viet Nam, the bones are rendered into a glue, a morsel  of which can then be dissolved into hot water (Stoner 2012). Research  conducted in Viet Nam and China suggests that a desire to consume wild  Tigers is preferred over farmed Tigers or Lions (wild or farmed), but  consumers will use all options (Coals <em>et al.</em> 2020). Consumption  of Tiger bone tonic is a status symbol, and Tiger wine is given as a  gift (UNODC 2020). Continued demand for Tiger bone supplies led to  seeking analogue species such as Lion, with much supply coming from the  legal farming and euthanasia of Lions in South Africa until the trade  ban (Milliken and Shaw 2012, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2017, EMS Foundation  and Ban Animal Trading 2018, Ban Animal Trading and EMS Foundation  2020), Jaguar (Lemieux and Bruschi 2019) and many other species such as  leopards and clouded leopards. There have been increasing reports of  Tiger farming to meet rising demand and falling wild stocks in the last  ten years, and anecdotal reports of wild Tigers captured live to stock  breeding programs (Environmental Investigation Agency 2017, UNODC 2020).  Multiple nations in the European Union have also been implicated in  exporting live Tigers from private collections to countries with  breeding facilities (Musing 2020). In contrast, some facilities in  Europe have begun processing captive Tiger products and shipping them  back to Viet Nam (TRAFFIC and WWF 2020). Tastes of elite business people  and criminal bosses in the Golden Triangle have led to the consumption  of Tiger meat.<br/><br/>Research suggests that Asian diasporas carry Tiger  and other big cat consumption habits and establish new consumption  centres outside Asia. A 2019 survey of shops in Vietnamese communities  in South Africa found that Tiger products were widespread (Nguyen 2019).<p></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>At a Tiger Summit held in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010, the 13  Tiger Range Countries adopted a Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP  2010). The goal was to effectively double the number of wild Tigers by  2022 through actions to:<br/><br/>i) effectively preserve, manage, enhance and protect Tiger habitats;<br/>ii) eradicate poaching, smuggling and illegal trade of Tigers, their parts and derivatives;<br/>iii) cooperate in transboundary landscape management and in combating illegal trade;<br/>iv) engage with indigenous and local communities;<br/>v) increase the effectiveness of Tiger and habitat management; and<br/>vi) restore Tigers to their former range.<br/><br/>All  of these actions are being implemented by governments and NGOs to  varying degrees in each range state. Details by country can be found in  the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>The Tiger Summit was attended by  Heads of State, including Russia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Bangladesh,  and represented significant government commitment to Tiger conservation.  This Summit is expected to be repeated in 2022 to assess progress  towards the goal at the end of the 12-year deadline for doubling global  Tiger numbers, and plan for the next 12 years.<br/><br/>The future of  Tigers depends upon the Asian governments creating effective Tiger  landscapes by conserving large areas of suitable habitat and by  maintaining habitat connectivity. Within these landscapes, the most  urgent need is to first secure the Source Sites (<em>sensu </em>Walston <em>et al.</em>  2010) - protected areas with the potential to contain viable Tiger subpopulations - where most of the global Tiger population is now  clustered. However, many Source Sites are currently too threatened to  deliver their potential as the demographic sources for species recovery  (Walston <em>et al.</em> 2010). Key to success will be eliminating  poaching and illegal trade in Tigers and their prey and habitat loss and  degradation within and outside of protected areas, while ensuring  connectivity within Tiger Conservation Landscapes. Further, with only  21% of Tiger habitat protected, expanding protected area systems,  enlarging the conservation portfolio to include areas beyond protected  areas, restoring connectivity between protected habitat remnants, as  well as improving the management effectiveness of existing protected  areas (Hossain <em>et al.</em> 2018, Stolton <em>et al.</em> 2019) will be  critical to recovery. In many areas, these will require empowering and  enabling communities living within and around Tiger habitats to  contribute to conservation actively.<br/><br/>Better collaboration among  Tiger conservation organizations, including NGOs and government, is also  needed, including developing an agreed-upon and shared vision and  strategy for Tiger conservation and sustainable financing thereof.<br/><br/>The  absence of Tigers across much of the species’ historical range, largely  due to poaching of both Tigers and prey, presents opportunities for  future range expansion and targeted Tiger reintroductions and  translocations. Tigers have been successfully reintroduced into a number  of protected areas in India and Russia (Sankar <em>et al.</em> 2010, Sarkar <em>et al.</em> 2016, Kolipaka <em>et al.</em> 2017, Rozhnov <em>et al.</em> 2021) and there are ongoing plans for reintroduction into former range countries including Kazakhstan and Cambodia (Chestin <em>et al.</em> 2017, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017b).</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

While the eastern population is thought to be stable or only slowly declining, it is also suspected to be very small. As a result, the species is listed as Endangered.","It inhabits Terai marshes and extensive stands of <em>Imperata, Narenga, Phragmites</em> and <em>Saccharum</em> grassland, particularly those that are seasonally inundated, with well-scattered trees, and occasionally interspersed with patchy rice and sugarcane cultivation. It is gregarious, foraging in flocks and breeding (May-September) in colonies. Nests are built in trees, reedbeds, or extensive stands of tall grass. Whilst its movements are poorly understood, populations appear to wander erratically.<p></p>","During the last 60 years, the Terai region has been almost totally  converted to human-dominated landscape with agriculture,  orchards, factories, canals, roads, expanding villages and cities, and  very rapid human population growth. The rising population of crows (<em>Corvus splendens</em> and <em>Corvus macrorhynchos</em>), related to garbage and human habitations, threatens nesting colonies (Bhargava 2000, 2017). These threats are compounded by capture for the live bird trade (Bhargava 2017).<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<br/><p></p>","Based on surveys conducted by Bhargava (2017) maximum numbers were fewer than 200 in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh together, and fewer than 300 in north-east India. However, the study also reported rapid declines in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, suggesting this number may be even lower today. The population in the Nepalese stronghold has been most recently counted as 254 individuals, following an expanded survey effort (Bird Conservation Nepal 2020), but nesting surveys in 2020 showed a continuing decline in the number of active nests and breeding birds, with 66 nests in 2020 down from 115 in 2019, and 133 birds down from 177 (Poudyal <em>et al.</em> 2020). Overall, the number of mature individuals is considered most likely to be 210–300 mature individuals in the western population and 200–250 in the eastern population. There may be a small number remaining in the disjunct West Bengal population, however there are few recent records from this area (Bhargava <em>et al.</em> 2017). The population is therefore suspected to fall in the band of 410–600 mature individuals, and estimated to lie within a wider band of 250–999 mature individuals, with no subpopulation larger than 250 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;is endemic to the Terai of the northern Indian subcontinent, where it is known from three disjunct populations: The western population occurs in Delhi, northern Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand states, <strong>India</strong>, and adjacent extreme western <strong>Nepal </strong>where it is a rare breeding resident and summer visitor. The eastern population occurs from eastern Nepal to Assam in India (BirdLife International 2001), and the southern population in West-Bengal. Throughout the range in India, the species was known from 17 discrete sites up to the year 2000. Extensive survey effort increased this to 47, but by 2017 only nine were still known to be occupied (Bhargava 2017).&#160;Notably, three of the locations where the species is currently recorded are new locations identified during 2016-2017 (Bhargava 2017). Surveys in north and north-east India also indicate that the species is very uncommon, even in protected areas where there has been little apparent habitat change (A.

The extent of occurrence (EOO) is around 600 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and the area of occupancy (AOO) is 8–10 km<sup>2</sup> in fragmented high elevation habitat. There are several threats to the habitat which include deforestation for mining, fuel wood, conversion to plantations and forest fires. The species is highly threatened and is assessed as Endangered.","The type specimen was collected in a wood on top of Patinghe hill, near Jeypore (Smith 1935). For the more recent collections, one individual was collected from under a rock in a patch of semi-evergreen forest at Deomali and one from a coffee plantation at Galikonda which still had many native shade trees (Agarwal <em>et al</em>. 2012). It therefore appears that this species is confined to semi-evergreen high altitude forests. All recent specimens were collected during the day and no animals were observed at night. Nothing else is known about the ecology of this species.","The forest habitats where this species occurs are under extreme pressure (Agarwal <em>et al</em>. 2012). Neither of the new localities is in a protected area and both are severely deforested. Galikonda and the surrounding hills have been converted to coffee plantations and at Deomali there are grazing and fuel wood collection pressures. The hills in the Koraput District also face pressure from bauxite mining. Generally semi-evergreen forests in this region have been converted to plantations (with exotic species), agriculture or grazing lands and the remaining forest patches are impacted by fuel wood collection and occasional forest fires. There are proposed bauxite mines on the mountains, including the type locality where no semi-evergreen forest patches - thought likely to be the critical microhabitat for this species - remain, and the rate of loss elsewhere is accelerating (Mohapatra). Monoculture plantations for silviculture (mainly silver oak and some eucalyptus) is ongoing across the species' range. The species is presumed to have been lost from the type locality, and the Deomali subpopulation is under immediate threat of extinction from rapid habitat degradation, including expansion&#160; and logging. (Mohapatra)","Nothing is known about the population size or trends of this species, but it appears to be extremely scarce given the low number of specimens and sightings to-date. It was not collected between its original description in 1870 and 2010, despite extensive work in the area. Only one individual was collected in 2010, and five or six were seen in Galikonda (Agarwal <em>et al. </em>2012). It has not been seen since despite multiple targeted searches at all three localities, as well as random sampling in other areas of high-elevation forest where the habitat is thought to be suitable (P.

The species had not been collected since it was originally found in 1877, and there were fears that it might be extinct. However, it was recently recorded (September 2010) from Deomali, Jeypore in Koraput District, Orissa about 10 km from the type locality (Agarwal <em>et al</em>. 2012). A further collection was also made in October 2011, 40 km away from the type locality at Galikonda, Visakhapatnam District, Andra Predesh (Agarwal <em>et al</em>. 2012). Within this area, its occurrence appears to be highly restricted at the two known sites, with a recent two-day survey failing to locate it in nearby areas. While there are a small number of high elevation peaks in the intervening area where it may occur, it is known with certainty only from the two recent localities and is presumed to have been lost from the type locality, where no suitable forest remains. The area of occupancy (AOO) is therefore provisionally estimated at 8–20 km<sup>2</sup>. It occurs at elevations between 1,200 to 1,300 m asl. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is around 600 km<sup>2</sup>.","The species is not known to be in use or trade, but it is an attractive species and could become the target of commercial collection.",Terrestrial,"There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for this species and none of the known localities is in a protected area. There is an urgent need for survey work to determine its range, and protect the areas where it occurs. Systematic surveys to clarify for its distribution and ecology across different seasons. in all suitable forest above 800 m, is needed to clarify this species' ecological requirements and to determine whether it is more widespread.",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

It is assumed to occur in 2-5 locations, based on prescribed burning to maintain the grassland habitats in the park, and while the impacts of fire are not understood and may not be leading to a long-term decline in the extent and quality of its habitat the species appears to have undergone a decline in the number of mature individuals since it was first detected in 2002. It is consequently listed as Endangered.",It inhabits grasslands within the park and does not occur in bare areas (Kastle <em>et al</em>. 2013).,"There are prescribed burnings in the park to maintain the grassland habitats for herbivores. While impacts are not thought to be severe, as the species has not been recorded recently fire may have a more significant impact on the population than presently understood.","There are no data on population size and trends for this species. The species was common when it was described in 2002 (Schleich and Kastle 2002). However, recent surveys have not recorded the species (S. Bhattarai pers. comm. 2019). The trend is unknown, but may be decreasing. It is unlikely that the prescribed burning is affecting mature individuals as the fires are set in winter, when the species is less active.",Unknown,This species is endemic to Nepal where it is restricted to Shuklaphantah National Park (Kastle <em>et al</em>. 2013),There is not suspected to be any substantial use or trade in this species.,Terrestrial,"There are no targeted conservation measures in place for this species. The entire known population is within Suklaphantah National Park, West Nepal. Research is needed into the natural history of the species and to determine if the prescribed burnings are impacting its population. This species is very similar to <em>Sitana sivalensis</em> and further research into its taxonomy is recommended.",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global
