33,1063259,164642,Naja oxiana,Near Threatened,A2c,2021,2016-04-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Near Threatened because, although this species is inferred to have undergone a historical population decline, potentially exceeding 30%, resulting from overexploitation, shrinkage in distribution, and habitat destruction and degradation, the heaviest exploitation has largely ceased since the 1990s, and so any decline is likely to have taken place more than three generations in the past. However, the decline due to loss of habitat is ongoing and is likely to be close to the threshold for Vulnerable.","It is widespread in arid habitats and can be found in rocky areas with dry shrubland (Latifi 1991), and sand dunes (N. Orlov pers. comm. September, 2008). In inhabited areas it will often enter houses in search of rodent prey (Khan 2006). It is an oviparous species that lays between eight and twelve eggs (Latifi 1991). Generation length appears not to have been documented, but for similarly-sized cobras three generations are typically in the region of 16-18 years.","The major threat to this species is the over-collection of animals for their use in anti-venom production, with many thousands of animals captured for this (G. Nilson, N. Ananjeva and N. Orlov pers. comm. September 2008); this may, however, have ceased in the mid-1990s in at least part of the snake's range. Collection of animals has been recorded from protected areas throughout the species range; declines have been reported for at least three of the species' eight range states, and are also thought likely to be ongoing in Pakistan and Tajikistan. While it may not be declining in Afghanistan, its distribution here is moderately limited. It is additionally threatened in parts of Middle Asia, through the conversion of land to the production of cotton and other agricultural uses; as a dryland species it will not tolerate areas given over the production of water-intensive crops like cotton. Subpopulations in Central Asian sandy desert are in a ""more favourable"" situation (Ananjeva <em>et al. </em>2006).","The Red Data Book of the USSR (1978) indicated that at this time its total estimated population in the country (representing most of its Central Asian range) was around 350,000, with densities reaching 1-1.5 individuals per hectare in favourable habitat. Evidence from throughout this region suggests that the species is undergoing widespread, significant declines in much of its range. Although it is not rare in Turkmenistan, it was once very common and is now in significant decline (N. Ananjeva and N. Orlov pers. comm. September 2008); this is also thought to be the case in Uzbekistan (Cnemonics International 2001). Declines are ongoing in this country (E. Rustamov pers. comm. 2017). The species is also declining in Iran (G. Nilson pers. comm. September 2008). Although it is probably not declining in Afghanistan, it is expected that the species is also declining in Pakistan (T. Papenfuss pers. comm. September 2008). &#160;There has been an extensive trade in snakes in Tajikistan over the 20 years since independence; while there is no data on the status of this species in Tajikistan, it may well be undergoing decline here as well (T. Sattorov pers. comm. 2016). Throughout its distribution declines are being driven by overharvesting for venom extraction, and secondarily by agricultural conversion. This is a very rare species in India.",Decreasing,"This Middle and Central Asian species ranges from the eastern shore of the Aral Sea east to northwestern India, and north to the Nura-Tau and Bel'-Tau-Ata mountain ranges and the western spurs of the Turkestansky range (Ananjeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). It is found in northeastern Iran, Turkmenistan (where it is widespread except for the extreme northwest), Uzbekistan, southwest Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern India. Within Iran, this species is known from Khorasan Province, Mazandaran Province and Seman Province (Latifi 1991). In Pakistan, this species is present in Northwest Frontier Provinces, and northeastern Baluchistan (Minton 1966). The easternmost historical records are from Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir.","This species was at least historically heavily collected for medicinal use, primarily for antivenin. This activity largely ceased at least in the former Soviet territories (based on available information from Takijistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) in the mid-1990s. There is no report of trade in India, but this is a very rare species in this country and information is limited.",Terrestrial,"There are many protected areas within the Middle Asian part of the species range, and there are a number of protected areas within the species Iranian range. Nevertheless this species faces a primary threat from overcollection, and harvesting has been reported from protected areas. The species is included within the Red Data Books of Uzbekistan and the former Soviet Union. It was formerly included in the Red Data Book for Turkmenistan, and the reasons for its removal from the 2011 edition are not clear as none of the pressures affecting this species have ceased. There is a need to better regulate collection of animals. Subpopulations should be monitored to record changes in abundance and distribution. This species is included in Appendix II of CITES.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global
51,1071806,164733,Eryx johnii,Near Threatened,,2021,2019-09-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although a widespread species, it is listed as Near Threatened as it is suspected to be in significant global decline (but at a rate of less than 30% over ten years) because it is being over-harvested for the pet trade and traditional medicine, making the species close to qualifying for Vulnerable.","It is a generally nocturnal and fossorial species found in flat desert with loose clay soil and sparse grasses. It can be found in sandy deserts and similar open areas with loose soil, although it is less common in these habitats (Minton 1966, Latifi 1991, Khan 2006), and is also rare on stony and damp soils (Khan 2006). In India it is also found in dry deciduous forest and scrub (Srinivasulu), and moist lowland forest in the northern Western Ghats (R. Vyas pers. comm. 2019). It can be found in a wide variety of modified habitats. In India, the females bear 6–14 live young around June and September; in Pakistan much smaller litters, of 2–8 animals born from April to June, have been reported (Khan 2006). Recorded prey items include Hardwicke's spiny-tailed lizard (<em>Saara hardwickii</em>) (Pardeshi <em>et al</em>. 2008).","In India, the species is threatened by illegal overcollection for the pet trade and for its use in traditional medicines in China and Southeast Asia, as well as in India itself. It is a highly prized species in traditional remedies for skin disease (Subramanean and Reddy 2012). This collection, while illegal, is largely uncontrolled and may be on the increase, as market prices have increased drastically due to recently established beliefs that the snake acts as a lucky charm or has supernatural powers (TRAFFIC Post 2011). The species is also subject to deliberate persecution (Balakrishan 2010). The region where it occurs in Afghanistan is sparsely populated so it is unlikely to be threatened here, although its range in this country is essentially unknown. Modern agricultural practices, including soil compaction and the use of pesticides and poisons that kill its rodent prey, and which remove areas of natural habitat retained under traditional management, are also likely to threaten this species (C. Srinivasulu and S. Thakur pers. comm. 2019). Harvesting is illegal in Nepal, but illegal poaching from hunters entering the border from India has been reported (S. Bhattarai pers. comm. 2019). Even within peri-urban and semi-urban areas, remnant habitat quality is in decline and development exposes greater numbers of animals to persecution and capture (S. Narayanan pers. comm. 2019). Generation length is thought to be around two years (R. Vyas pers. comm. 2019).","It is common in Pakistan and in west, central and southern India. It is uncommon in Nepal (S. Bhattarai pers. comm. 2019). The species is a human commensal and may benefit to some extent from land use changes that increase the abundance of rodent prey, however, declines have been reported in southern India. Based on researchers' observations, sighting records have declined in some areas, and it is thought that illegal collectors have to put increasing efforts into harvesting animals for trade. It was formerly common in agricultural areas, but now appears to be rare (S. Thakur pers. comm. 2019). Rescue numbers report high numbers of confiscated animals being taken from trade markets (C. Srinivasulu pers. comm. 2019). Population trends in Nepal, where it is encountered in lower numbers than many other snakes, are unclear (S. Bhattarai pers. comm. 2019).",Decreasing,"This species&#160;ranges throughout most of Pakistan, and is present in adjoining parts of eastern Afghanistan and<span style=""""> southeastern I</span>ran (Khan 2006,<span style=""""> Mohammad<em> et al</em>. 2017), ran</span>ging eastward through mainland India (except the northeast). It has been recorded from Nepal, in Chitwan National Park (Bhattarai <em>et al</em>. 2017) and Parsa, in 2012 (Bhattarai <em>et al</em>. 2018), and appears to occur throughout the Terai. In Iran, this species is known only from three specimens collected from Zabol and Sistan va Baluchistan Provinces (Latifi 1991, T. Papenfuss pers. comm. September 2008); it may occur more widely in this country but there are no records yet (K. Milto pers. comm. 2016). It is known from a single locality - ""Mundi, Hissar south of Kandahar"" - in Afghanistan (Wagner <em>et al</em>. 2016). Sindaco <em>et al. </em>(2013) consider the Iranian and Afghan records doubtful, but do not justify this; in contrast T. Papenfuss (pers. comm. 2016) suggests that it is likely to occur throughout the southern third of the country. It is found below 200 m asl (Khan 2006).","In India, this species is traded illegally for national markets (for medicine and snake charmers) and in international markets (including China where it is believed to be an aphrodisiac). In India, it is collected also for the national and international pet trade, where it is in high demand (R. Vyas pers. comm. 2019). Live animals are used in zoo therapy in Pakistan (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2011). It is sold for high prices, indicating high demand, and is sold online. Reports exist of animals having been stolen from zoos (S.R. Ganesh pers. comm. 2019).",Terrestrial,"It is not known if the species is present in any protected areas in Iran.

It shelters in deep cracks, rat burrows and piles of rocks or bricks. It feeds on rodents, lizards, amphibians and ground feeding birds. Cannibalistic behaviour has also been observed in this snake (D'Abreu 1915). It is a viviparous snake. The breeding season extends from November to January after which 6–8 young are born from May to August (Daniel 2002, Whitaker and Captain 2004).","This snake is under some pressure due to trade both locally as well as for the international market.

The species is likely to be relatively secure within protected areas in this country (S. Bhattarai pers. comm.). Modern agricultural practices, including soil compaction and the use of pesticides and poisons that kill its rodent prey, and which remove areas of natural habitat retained under traditional management, are also likely to threaten this species (C.

Himalayan gorals feed on grassy ridges and steep rocky slopes, but hide in forest or rock crevices; it seeks shelter under rock overhangs. Gorals are diurnal, and are most active in the early morning and late evening, but can be active throughout on overcast days. Group home range size is typically around 40 hectares, with males occupying marked territories of 22-25 hectares durring the mating season. Males usually single; otherwise found in pairs or small parties. They typically live in small groups of 4-12 individuals; older males are usually solitary. The diet consists of grasses, leaves, twigs, fruits, and nuts. The gestation length is 170-218 days, with single births. Males and females reach sexual maturity at three, sometimes two years (Hayseen <em>et al</em> 1993), with a lifespan of up to 15 years.","The main threats come from habitat destruction, hunting, and possibly from competition with livestock (Maqsood, 1989).<br/><br/>In China, hunting is probably the main threat to its survival; however, the extent is unknown. It may be limited due to the predominant religious beliefs of Tibetan people, which reduces hunting. In Bhutan, although some parts of the range are in reasonable condition, in other areas, its habitat is being destroyed by overgrazing by livestock, and in the area previously in Doga National Park, by grass burning during the dry season (Blower, 1985a).  <br/><br/>In India, within protected areas, the status of goral populations is probably satisfactory. Nevertheless, they are often hunted for meat even within many of the protected areas. The most significant threat to them is severe habitat disturbance and alteration, particularly in the lower portions of the Himalayas and in northeastern India. However, limited disturbance and habitat alteration that creates or maintains some shrub and forest cover, may not be greatly detrimental to the survival of goral populations. In Nepal, the threats are poaching, and habitat destruction resulting from logging, agriculture and livestock grazing.","<em>Naemorhedus goral goral</em><br/>No estimate of population size is available in China, but numbers are thought to be small (Feng <em>et al</em>., 1986).

If suitable habitats are available in the absence of excessive hunting - even with moderate human disturbance (e.g. grass and fodder cutting) - goral can occur in good numbers. Its forested habitat makes censusing populations difficult in Nepal.<br/><br/><em>Naemorhedus goral bedfordi</em><br/>There is no total estimate of population size for <em>N. g. bedfordi</em>. Two hundred animals were counted during a wildlife census by the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1987). A total of 233 were estimated in the NWF in 1992 (NWFP, 1992). During this census, no goral were recorded in Abbottabad or Swat Districts. Eight-hundred ninety-three were estimated in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (Qayyum, 1986-87).

In India, the Himalayan goral is apparently patchily distributed along the Himalayan mountain ranges in Jammu and Kashmir, with reports of its presence in Dachigam National Park (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>., unpublished data), Kisthwar National Park and possibly in the Limber Wildlife Sanctuary.

Reports also confirm its continued presence between 1,600 and 2,100 m in the Simla Water Catchment Reserve and the Chail and Majathal Harsang Wildlife Sanctuaries in Himachal Pradesh (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Lovari and Apollonio 1993). Goral is also widespread in Uttaranchal Pradesh (Singh 1985; Negi 2002).

Roberts (1977) stated that within the Federal Capital Territory and the Rawalpindi District of the Punjab Province, it inhabited the Murree foothills and the Margalla range. However, its present occurrence in Punjab is doubtful (Chaudhry, unpublished data). Roberts (1977) also mentioned the occurrence of the species in Azad Jammu and Kashmir in parts of the Neelum Valley beyond Ath Muqam (District Muzaffarabad), while Qayyum (1985) and the Zoological Survey Department (1986) describe it in the District of Kotli, at three places in the District of Muzaffarabad, and in the region of Poonch. In the NWFP, its range extends from the Districts of Abbottabad, Mansehra, Mardan, Kohistan and Swat, to the areas of Dir, Malakand and Nowshera which possibly still form the western limit of its range.

Although Doga National Park was established mainly to protect this goral, the habitat is so degraded by exploitation that the Park is of almost no conservation value for the species (Blower, 1986; Wollenhaupt, 1989a) and has since been removed from the country’s protected areas system. Conservation measures proposed for Bhutan: Surveys to determine numbers and distribution.<br/><br/>In India, both the Western Himalayan goral (<em>N. goral bedfordi</em>) and the Eastern Himalayan goral (<em>N. g. gopal</em>) are listed as Lower Risk/near threatened, which allows adult male goral to be hunted under special license. This status has essentially been applied to all forms of goral and accepted by all states except Nagaland and in Himachal Pradesh where goral are legally and completely protected. Some 50 protected areas in India are reported to include some goral (Singh, 1985; Rodgers and Panwar, 1988; Pandey 2002), including  Jammu and Kashmir - Kishtwar National Park, Nandni and Surinsar Mansar Wildlife Sanctuaries, and possibly in Limber Game Reserve and Overa-Aru Wildlife Sanctuary (latest surveys fail to document species’ presence); Himachal Pradesh- Great Himalayan National Park, Bandi Churdar, Chail, Daranghati, Darlaghat, Gamgul Siahbehi, Kalatop-Khajjiar, Kanawar, Khokhan, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Majathal, Manali, Naina Devi, Nargu, Raksham Chitkul, Renuka, Rupi Bhaba, Sangla valley, Sechu Tuan Nala, Shikari Devi, Shilli (locally threatened), Simbalbara, Simla Water Catchment, Talra, Tirthan and Tundah (locally threatened) Wildlife Sanctuaries; Uttaranchal (Negi 2002) - Corbett, Nanda Devi, Rajaji and Valley of Flowers National Parks, Askot, Sonanadi, Binsar, Musorriie, Govind Pashu Vihar and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuaries; Sikkim - Khangchendzonga National Park; Megahalaya - Balphakram National Park; and Assam - possibly in Buxa Tiger Reserve. Conservation measures proposed for India: 1) Establish the proposed Srikhand National Park (Himachal Pradesh) which includes the range of <em>N. g. bedjordi</em>. 2) Develop a management program for goral living outside protected areas. Habitat alteration and disturbance by heavy grazing and hunting will continue to negatively affect goral populations throughout northern India. However, it is apparently able to survive in areas of substantial human farming and grazing activity, as long as patches of rugged, brush-covered slopes are maintained. 3) Develop a management plan to prevent overhunting in non-protected areas, and to increase effective protection in parks and sanctuaries, if viable populations are to be maintained.<br/><br/>In Nepal, goral occurs in eight National Parks (Khaptad, Lake Rara, Langtang, Makalu-Barun (and Conservation Area), Royal Bardia, Royal Chitwan, Sagarmatha, and Shey-Phoksundo; Wegge and Oli 1997), as well as within the Annapurna Conservation Area, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve and Parsa Wildlife Reserve. Conservation measures for Nepal include:  1) In some areas, consider a management program for sustainable, low level, subsistence hunting by local villagers and trophy hunting, after goral population censuses and productivity studies have been made. Basic research on the relationship between habitat type and goral abundance is vital if subsistence cropping is to be promoted. 2) DNPWC could perhaps conduct a case study of this relationship within one of the park buffer zones. This would not only provide the much needed data, but also might deflect some of the local concern about crop damage caused by this species). <br/><br/><em>Naemorhedus goral bedfordi</em><br/>The subspecies in Pakistan is legally protected, as are all wild mammals in the country, but enforcement of the laws is not satisfactory. A proposal has been made (Green 1993) that Margalla Hills NP should include a 3,100 ha enclosure for captive breeding and reintroductions. In 1988, between 40 and 60 goral were reported in this National Park (Maqsood, 1989).

It could also occur in Goa. It occurs in only certain areas with a very patchy distribution.  The extent of occurrence of this species has been estimated as slightly more than 20,000 km² (approximately 25,000 km²). Area of occupancy has not been estimated. The habitat where the species occurs is severely fragmented and degraded due to road widening, cutting of trees, bund maintenance, soil erosion and other kinds of human interference. In protected areas, the situation is better. It is assumed that the area of habitat has decreased over the years. There is evidence of trade in this species as seen on internet web sites of traders advertising and hobbyists exchanging notes. Although the volume of trade is not known, this along with decreasing habitat quality and area of occupancy make the species being close to Vulnerable. It is categorized as Near Threatened since it misses the restricted distribution criteria.","This ground spider is primarily found in moist deciduous and evergreen forests. The species occurs very patchily, with burrows on soil bunds with adequate vegetation cover. Burrows occasionally occur on flat ground. In examining the burrow aggregations, we have found the composition to have one adult female with several juveniles and sub adults from different clutches in individual burrows close to the adult female's burrow. Observations on population indicates a very high mortality rate in juveniles/subadults, of more than 95% in the first two years. Dispersal rates are unknown. Healthy population of spiders/burrows are usually found in areas with very little disturbance.","Habitat loss and degradation are major threats. Road widening is most common threat for these ground theraphosid spiders. Many spiders get killed and their burrows get destroyed during this process. Mud bund maintenance in forested areas along with man made fires and soil erosion are other threats. In more open areas, soil extraction and erosion are the reasons for disappearance of these spiders. An additional threat to the species is collection for the international pet trade market.

It prefers dense forest (Choudhury 2001), and does not usually occur in secondary forest. It is found in tropical and subtropical semi­evergreen forests, dry deciduous and montane Forest (Srivistava and Mohnot 2001, R. Boonratana pers. comm.). Particular habitats and niches vary some depending on the subspecies. This species is found from the floodplains to the high mountains, up to 2,800 m, and sometimes 3,000 m in the summer (Choudhury 2001), and perhaps up to 4,000 m (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001, Zhang <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2002). It is generally an upland species, and usually associated with hill areas above 1,000 m. In the wetter east the species may also frequent areas that do not or only marginally reach 1,000m and may occur even in the lowlands. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is predominantly associated with high altitudes, usually above 500 m. In forests on limestone karst the species occurs in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). Six sites at 200-400 m asl range in Karst habitats were reported from Lao PDR: Houay Phasong, Nam Ngo, and 4 sites in Muang Vilabouli (Timmins and Duckworth 2013)</p>  <p>The generation of this species is 10­-12 years (Molur <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2003). There is a wide preference of vegetation across the macaque distribution. From subtropical mid-elevation montane broadleaf rainforests and temperate evergreen forests of higher elevations. In Thailand, they occupy mixed deciduous/bamboo dry evergreen forest from lowland to mountainous areas. Rocky crags and karsts are also preferred sleeping sites. They are also found close to human settlements where they are provisioned and in many areas like Kanchanaburi Province (14°41’N), Thailand they have resorted to begging. </p>  <p>There is a gradual change in preference for food in certain areas of their distribution such as in Darjeeling, West Bengal of which eleven of their 63 preferred plant species are cultigens. Generally, their natural diet includes fruits such as banana, mango, papaya, apple, litchi, cucumber, papaya, orange, bamboo shoots, and leaves. They are also used to feeding of human hands and prefer food such as bread, other varieties of cooked snacks, molasses. </p>  <p>In Assam the species raid the vegetable gardens, crop land and villages near to their habitats (Chetry and Das pers. comm.).</p>  <p>Dietary studies in Nonggang, China, conducted between 2005 and 2006 suggest folivorous inclination: 77.4% of all feeding records were of leaves and 17.4% of total feeding records were of fruits. Young leaves formed the ‘bulk’ of the diet with their consumption ration varying from 44.9% in July to 92.9% in May. <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calicolus</em>, a type of bamboo and its unexpanded leaves formed the bulk of the young leaf diet (Zhou <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2011)</p>  <p>Follow-up studies conducted in Nonggang between 2012 and 2013 corroborate the finding. While leaves were dominant in the diet (75.5%), the leaves of&#160; <em>Bonia</em><em> </em><em>saxatilis</em> bamboo were more preferred as opposed to <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calicolus</em>. Seventy-eight food species were reported to be consumed by the macaques in the region (Huang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) </p>  <p>Modest swelling of sexual skin during breeding. Gestation of 5.5 months and single young born every two years. There is seasonal migration to higher altitudes in summer and to lower altitudes in winter. Multimale-multifemale type social organization. Schulke <em>et al.</em> (2010) derived the relationship between social bonds and reproductive success in wild macaques in Thailand. Tight social bonds in male macaques was seen to promote good ‘coalition’ which in turn translated into social dominance and reproductive success. Female Assamese macaques tend to exhibit ‘non-random’ and ‘promiscuous’ mating across male ranks and mate more frequently with certain males while exhibiting ‘concealed’ fertility. This tactic could in fact protect infants during intra-troop change in male dominance and as suggested in the literature, to main special and particular bonds in a rather open and ‘promiscuous’ environment (Furtbauer <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2014)</p>  <p>Average group size of 20 individuals. Group size in Nonggang 15-17 individuals. Single males outside group have been spotted.</p>  <p>Home range of 53-65 ha and mean daily path length of 590-782 m as studied in Nonggang Food distribution seems to influence the macaques distribution wherein most of their time was seen to be spent on cliffs (71.7% of total location records) and hillsides (20.2%). The cliffs and hill tops are often inundated with <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calcicolus</em>, the primary preferred leaf source of macaques (Zhou <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;2014).</p>  <p>Parasite prevalence rate in Assamese macaques in Shivpuri Nagarjuna National Park was 72.94%. Protozoan and helminth parasites were found during faecal studies in the macaques suggesting such parasites as conservation threats to the species (Pokhrel and Maharajan 2014). </p>","The threats to this species' habitat include selective logging and various forms of anthropogenic development and activities, alien invasive species, and hunting and trapping for sport,“medicine,” food, and the pet trade. Additionally, hybridization with adjacent species poses a threat to some populations (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although it has a wide distribution, the species is considered to be threatened in most parts of its range. Habitat destruction is the primary cause of the decline. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses the greatest risk to this species in northeastern India (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). However, it has been hunted in the Himalayan regions of North Bengal, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, where it frequently invades crops (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). Locals use skulls as an “evil eye” in front of houses in northeastern India (Das pers. comm.). There has been extensive habitat loss over the last 15 years in several states of northeastern India (from 30 to 60%), with major impacts on <em>M. a. assamensis</em>. <br/><br/>The Nepal population of <em>Macaca assamensis </em>is threatened due to its restricted distribution of less than 2,200 km² extent of occurrence and 914 km area of occupancy and continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, the number of locations and in the number of mature individuals the latter two conditions being inferred from threats to habitat and population from degradation and hunting, respectively. Given its restricted extent of occurrence, threats on its population and habitat, and small numbers in fragmented patches, the Nepal population of this macaque is categorized as Endangered.<br/><br/>In Thailand habitat loss is the primary threat, hunting for food less so (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). It is protected only in temples.<br/><br/>In eastern Myanmar habitat loss is the primary threat, but hunting is presumed to occur. They are hunted to make footwear, and the skins are taken to Tibet as it is more profitable than taking it to Yunnan province of China. In northern Myanmar, hunting and habitat loss due to conversion are the major threats. There is more than 30% decline in forest cover over the last 30-­35 years. The combination of habitat loss and hunting heavily impacts the subpopulations, and the threats are likely to continue in the next three decades if the demand for this continues in Tibet (S. Htun pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the primary threat is hunting for food and for bones to make balm and/or glue. The bones are not used within Lao PDR, but sold to Viet Namese and traders within Lao PDR. The balm is used for pain relief and other speculative “medicinal” purposes. The trade also goes into China (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). This species has declined in VietNam and Lao PDR in the last 30-35 years by more than 30%, and is expected to continue to decline in the future.<br/><br/>In Tibet the habitat is good, but there is some hunting, and no detailed data exists for <em>M. a. pelops</em> from that region of China (Z. Zhou et al. pers. comm.). For <em>M. a. assamensis</em>, Hunting is a major threat. Logging has ceased, but was a major threat for the last 30 years. Conversion to pastures is still ongoing, but not a significant threat There are extensive habitats still left for this subspecies and the taxon is relatively safe. <br/><br/>Habitat reduction and degradation, agricultural activities, mining, rapid developmental activities in certain areas of the macaque’s distribution, hunting for food, traditional medicine, selective logging, loss of fruiting trees and human encroachment into critical macaque habitat, gold mining and shifting cultivation in Viet Nam, limestone mining destroying the macaques preferred habitats. Poaching for food and hunting for sale, political unrest in Myanmar are some existing serious threats.","There is little information available on the global population. Although it is thought to be relatively high, there is decline in the wild populations in certain countries, but not throughout the distribution. It is probably the most common macaque species in Lao PDR, where it is widespread through hill and mountain forest ranges, though no population estimate is available (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, R. Timmins pers. comm). In Nepal the taxon is also restricted to less than 300 mature individuals, distributed in eight subpopulations, with no subpopulation having more than 50 mature individuals. There is no information on population estimates from Thailand (R. Boonratana pers. comm). In northern Myanmar it is a very common species, but information from the eastern part of the country is not available (S. Htun pers. comm). <br/><br/>Due to hunting pressure, macaques in Viet Nam are scarce. However, there is no precise information for this species on population and status (R. Timmins pers. comm). The subspecies <em>M. a. assamensis </em>is relatively widespread in its extent of occurrence (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh, India, the population was found to have a group density of 1.11/km and an average group size of 13.93 individuals (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). This species is the most abundant monkey in the mountains of Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2001). In China 8,200 individuals is reported in 2009 (Long and Jiang pers. comm). The subspecies <em>M. a. pelops</em> is only found in adjacent populations in India, Bhutan, and adjacent China. There are likely fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2002). A subpopulation of <em>M. assamensis </em>is endemic to Nepal and relegated to a single population there, and is considered as a possible new subspecies (M. Chalise pers. comm.). However, further taxonomic clarification is needed.<br/><br/>No new population estimate in any of the macaque’s distribution. The macaques though have seen remarkable decline in population over the years and still under threat (refer to threats section) from numerous unsustainable activities.<br/><br/>In China, in the 1950s and 1960s the macaques are believed to be quite numerous and very much common in south-eastern Yunnan and in Gunagxi until they became really rare due to the threat of hunting and trapping for traditional medicine.",Decreasing,"<em>Macaca assamensis</em> occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, southwestern China (Guangxi, Guizhou, Tibet and Yunnan), northwestern India (Uttarakhand), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, and West Bengal), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, northwestern Thailand, and northern Viet Nam. It is found from western Nepal east into northern Myanmar and southeast through southernmost China to the upper Mekong in Tibet, and in the east into southern Guizhou to Hoi Xuan in Viet Nam and Thateng in Lao PDR; the range continues south through the Myanmar/Thailand border ranges as far as Chongkrong, as well as to the Sunderbans in Bangladesh. <br/><br/>There is a gap in northeastern India between the two main population pockets, specifically between central Bhutan and the south side of the Brahmaputra; the east bank of its upper course, the Dibang, marks the division between the two subspecies (Groves 2001).

While the species may not be declining at the same rate everywhere, it is suspected that this decline is widespread.","The species’ ecology and habitat requirements are surprisingly poorly  known and poorly documented in the literature given it is consistently  described as a common species throughout its range. This species is  found in a variety of habitats ranging from tropical moist forest to  urban environments. Roosts have been predominantly found in caves and  abandoned buildings (e.g., forts and houses as well as water tunnels,  Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2015, Sharma <em>et al.</em> 2020). It feeds on fruit  (e.g., <em>Ficus </em>spp., <em>Musa </em>sp., flowers and leaves, Vanhalnghaka 2015).  Additionally, it has been shown to occasionally feed on small fish  (Ghose and Chosal 1984).

The decline  is expected to continue due to a continuing rise in hunting that stems  from increased demand of taxidermy ornaments worldwide. Some local  populations may be also threatened by the increasing habitat alteration,  vehicular traffic and disturbance to the roosts.","The species has been recorded in dry deciduous forests, dry dipterocarp  forest, small woodland patches, floodplain and various agriculture lands  such as paddy field, sugarcane field, orchard and mixed plantation  (Sharma 1986, Kruskop 2013, Madhavan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  2015, Hawkeswood and Sommung 2017). It is found roosting mainly in dried  leaves of banana, dry grass and sugar cane, but occasionally in green  leaves of banana and broadleaf trees, flower, half-built nest of Baya  weaver bird on mesquite tree, and paper shelter for wrapping guava fruit  (Sharma 1986, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hawkeswood and Sommung 2017, Patel <em>et al.</em> 2017). In northern Thailand, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  (2015) reported the roost sites are generally near irrigation water.  This species mostly roosts at a height between 1-1.5 m from the ground.  It frequently switches roost sites at short distances (&lt;800 m) every  to four days. It forms small family of three bats (one adult male, one  adult female, and one young) from February to September, but remain  singly and in pair in November and December. Paired animals primarily  have high fidelity of partnership through years with shared home range  but have no overlap with other individual, expect their young in a year.  Individual home range is generally small, 6.1 ha for males and 5.6 ha  for females in average, at short distance from day roosts (c. 350 m  averagely). The bat mainly feeds on small web spiders (Funakoshi <em>et al.</em>  2015) most likely associated with its behaviour of fluttering flight  near ground vegetation (Smith and Xie 2013) and short high frequency  echolocation calls (Sripathy <em>et al.</em> 2006). They are apparently active during the day and are relatively sluggish when disturbed (Smith and Xie 2013).","The species is currently threatened by a large demand for its dry  specimen and skulls as tourism souvenir and ornament accessories in both  physical shops (locally and in foreign countries) and online worldwide  (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2015). Specimens on sale have been observed in  souvenir shops in Ho Chi Minh city in Viet Nam and Weimar city in  Germany. It is also sold online worldwide, at least in Australia, China,  France, Japan, Netherlands, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United  States. Roost disturbance is another threat to this species most likely  due to its notable colouration and use of commercial crop plants in  cultivation lands. Witness of the bats in farming areas by local people have occasionally been reported from Sri Lanka and Thailand. In Sri  Lanka, a roadkill incidence (Karunarathna <em>et al.</em> 2017) and a cat  kill (Tharaka Kusuminda, pers. com.) of this species have been reported.  In South Asia, this species is potentially threatened by habitat loss,  through commercial logging, conversion of plantation lands to make way  for human settlements and changes in cropping pattern (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002). Since most records of the species are from cultivated habitats,  use of chemicals for agriculture management is expected to be also  influential to the species.","Although the species is widespread, it does not appear to be common.  This may indicate its natural rarity or reflect a sampling bias from the  insufficient survey effort in non-forested habitats in its  distribution. It is usually found singly or in small groups with up to  four individuals in a single roost in South and Southeast Asia (Sharma  1986, Funakoshi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Patel <em>et al.</em>2017). In Thailand, 8-90 individuals were recorded from a single study site of 11 km² in area (Funakoshi <em>et al.</em> 2015).",Decreasing,"This is a widespread species that has been recorded from  southern, northern, and northeastern South Asia, southern China,  mainland Southeast Asia and some major islands in insular Southeast  Asia.

The  declines are expected to continue for at least another 10 years (three  generations in total; GL = 5 years, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The species has been recorded from various types of forest, including  karst forest, lowland secondary forest, subtropical forest, submontane  forest, and mangrove (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Lee <em>et al.</em> 2007, Bates <em>et al.</em> 2008, Furey <em>et al.</em> 2010, Loi and Thong). It has also been observed flying near surface of backwater near forest (Abramov <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/><br/>It is primarily a cave-dweller and uses several types of roosting habitats such as cave, tree hollow (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002), man-made tunnel, abandoned mining cave (Fang and Cheng 2011),  and beneath of big rock (Tsai, W.-Y. pers. comm.). In Taiwan, roost  sites are highly associated with forest. It has been recorded using the  same caves with <em>Rhinolophus monoceros</em>, <em>R. formosae</em>, <em>Hipposideros  armiger</em>, <em>Myotis laniger</em> and <em>Miniopterus fuliginosus </em>(Fang and Cheng  2011). In Vietnam, this species is known from the same cave with  <em>Hipposideros alongensis</em> (Thong <em>et al.</em> 2012) and with <em>Rhinolophis  affinis</em>, <em>Rh. pusillus</em>, <em>Hipposideros larvatus</em> and <em>Myotis muricola</em> in  other caves (Son, unpublished data). In Indonesia, this species roosts  in the cave, together with <em>Hipposideros larvatus </em>(Wiantoro, S. pers.  Com.).

C.-C.,  unpub. data). <br/><br/>Pregnant females were observed between March to  May and gave birth of one offspring in May and June. Young bats were  able to fly by 40 days after the birth. No evidence shows it hibernates  or torpors in a year. In Taiwan, the species remains active in winter,  when most of the other cave bat species hibernate (Fang and Cheng 2011).  <br/><br/>It is generally a lowland species, of which most occurrence  reports were from elevation less than 1,000 m asl. The species is found  foraging mainly in clutter vegetation close to the ground in forest  understory (Fang, Y.-P. pers. com.), which is likely associated with its  slow flight (Lai 2000) and low duty-cycled echolocation strategy (Ho <em>et al.</em>  2013). In Taiwan, the species has been reported to feed mainly on  spiders and some insects, including adult lepidopterans, coleopterans,  dipterans and homopterans (Fang and Cheng 2011).","Overall the species is most likely threatened by habitat loss and  degradation associated with ongoing deforestation and disturbances to  roosts in large area of its distribution range in Southeast Asia, South  Asia and China. Declining of population is expected at the global scale.  In Taiwan, decreasing gene flows among geographic populations with  increasing geographic distance were reported (Fang and Cheng 2011),  suggesting the species is a poor disperser. In account of the  association with forest and slow flight behavior, it is presumably  vulnerable to loss and fragmentation of forest. The expansion of road  systems could also threat the species. Two roadkill incidences are  reported from lowland in Taiwan where forest is highly fragmented by  road systems (<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://roadkill.tw/"">https://roadkill.tw/</a>).  Roost disturbances and destruction likely threaten the species. Loss of  roost sites, especially large maternity roosts, is expected to  interrupt gene flows among the nearby colonies. Light pollution might be  also a threat since individuals are observed avoiding artificial light  by cave entrance (Huang, J. C.-C., pers. obs.). In South Asia, some  populations are threatened by deforestation, generally resulting from  logging operations and the conversion of land to agriculture and  settlements especially in the Indian northeast (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002). In Bangladesh, cyclones represent an additional threat to the  habitat. In Indonesia, especially Java Island, limestone mining is  become the major threat on their roosting sites (Wiantoro S, pers. obs).","The species is thought to undergoing a past and continuing decline  across its range. Although the species is widespread, it does not appear  to be common. This may indicate its natural rarity or reflect  difficulties in surveying the species. It is usually found in groups of  less than 20 or fewer individuals in South Asia (Molur <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002), Thailand (Bates <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2008) and Taiwan (Fang and Cheng 2011), except a few colonies of 50~350  animals in Taiwan (Fang and Cheng 2011, Ying-Yi Ho pers. obs.).",Decreasing,"This widespread species ranges from South Asia eastwards into  southeastern China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.

Argali are sensitive to deep snow, particularly if forage is limiting; often migrating from high mountain habitats during winter, but are present all year round at lower elevations in the Gobi desert (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2005; Murdoch <em>et al</em>. 2017a, 2017b). Most argali live on alpine grasslands between 3,000-5,500 m, often descending lower in winter (particularly if snow accumulates to more than a few cm). In some areas, (e.g., Gobi desert of southern Mongolia, Karaganda area of Kazakhstan), they live in lower elevation, semi-arid areas. They generally avoid forested areas (except in Kazakhstan, where they are presumed to occupy forests because of displacement from preferred habitats, Fedosenko and Blank 2005). They prefer to occupy open areas with a gentle slope; females generally occupy steeper (cliff) terrain following lambing. Argali feed on grasses, sedges, and some herbs and lichens, and they regularly drink from open springs and rivers (Wingard <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Where sympatric with blue sheep they are more likely to occur in grass-dominated communities compared to the sedge-dominated communities occupied by blue sheep. Argali are gregarious and live in groups from 2-150 individuals, with aggregations of 1,000 and more individuals reported from Tajikistan (Michel and Muratov 2010; Singh <em>et al</em>. 2010; unpublished data ANCOT). Wolves <em>Canis lupus</em> and snow leopards <em>Panthera uncia</em> are their primary natural predator, although smaller predators feed on lambs (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2009). Gestation is about 160 days, and females give birth to one offspring (twins are occasionally reported in the literature, but documentation is poor). Mothers separate from the herd to give birth and remain alone with her offspring for several days. Females are sexually mature at 2 years, while males may not sexually mature until 5 years; maximum life-span is 10-13 years (Fedosenko and Blank 2005).</p>","<p>The main threats are poaching (for meat), competition, displacement and possibly disease transmission by domestic livestock, and habitat loss. In general, argali appear to be extremely intolerant of human disturbance (Fedosenko 1999; Namgail 2004; Maroney 2006; Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2007; Harris 2007; Schaller and Kang 2008) although observations in areas without poaching and disturbance by livestock and dogs (see Young <em>et al</em>., 2011), e.g., the Kumtor Gold Mine and Sarychat Ertash Strictly Protected Area, suggest that argali can become habituated to human presence. International border fences present a barrier to movement and dispersal of argali, prevent access to optimal seasonal grazing sites and increase fragmentation and genetic isolation (Luikart <em>et al</em>. 2011; Rosen 2012; CMS 2014; Hussain <em>et al</em>. 2018). These threats appear to vary little among argali populations, even though habitats vary.<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, poaching is generally considered to be a continuing threat to argali, the presidential ban on hunting notwithstanding. <br/> <br/> In China, poaching has been considered to be a substantial threat (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1997; Schaller 1998). In the mid-1990s however, a nationwide effort to confiscate guns from pastoralists substantially reduced the weaponry available for poaching. This, together with continued efforts to publicize the national law prohibiting killing protected species, appears to have reduced poaching during the last decade or so. At the same time however, efforts to regularize and sedentarize pastoralists generally increased habitat conflicts, because pastoralists typically intensified their use of productive grasslands preferred by argali, thus displacing them (Harris 2007, 2010). Additionally, industrial development in particular mining threatens the availability and quality of argali habitat (Harris <em>et al.</em>2009, Harris 2010). <br/> <br/> Some of the strongest data suggesting interference competition from livestock as a limiting factor for argali comes from Ladakh, India, where Namgail <em>et al</em>. (2007) and Singh (2008) documented argali shifting their habitat preference toward escape terrain and away from preferred foraging areas when livestock were present. Intensifying livestock grazing may cause fragmentation of argali habitat in Ladakh and prevent recovery (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk, 2001, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> As elsewhere, livestock grazing and poaching were considered the principal limiting factors to argali in Kazakhstan by Fedosenko (1999b). FAO statistics confirm that livestock numbers are increasing in Kazakhstan and this affects the availability and quality of argali habitat. </p>  <p>There is general consensus that habitat conditions for argali improved after Kyrgyzstan’s independence in 1991, due to the collapse of the state-supported livestock sector and consequent reduction in grazing pressure in the Tian Shan and Pamirs (Farrington 2005). It is unclear whether relatively low livestock density near the Chinese border will continue. Poaching and competition with livestock are also considered threats in Kyrgyzstan (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). After independence in 1991, the number of domestic sheep herded into argali habitat declined dramatically, which likely had a beneficial effect. However, since 2000 there livestock numbers have again risen. <br/> <br/> The main threat facing argali in Mongolia is poaching for subsistence (meat) and increasingly for their horns, which are increasingly being used as substitute horn in traditional Chinese medicine (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001; Amgalanbaatar 2002b; Clark <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Also important are the impacts from local, nomadic pastoralists who displace argali, whose livestock feed on the same forage as argali, and whose dogs chase and even kill argali (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 1998, 2003, 2005; Wingard 2005; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2006; Young <em>et al</em>. 2011). More minor and localized threats include unsustainable trophy hunting (Amgalanbaatar 2002a; Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004; Wingard and Zahler 2006; Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016) and habitat loss resulting from rapidly increasing resource extraction (i.e., mining) (Reading <em>et al</em>. 1998, 1999, 2001, 2005). Subsistence poaching by miners general represents a greater threat than actual mining activities, but this may change as the number of mines continues to grow rapidly. These threats remain important due to poor or non-existence law enforcement throughout most of the range of the species in Mongolia. Very little money from trophy hunting currently supports conservation activities in Mongolia (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a; Wingard and Zahler 2006; Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016).<br/> <br/> In Pakistan, in addition to disturbance from livestock (grazing in Khunjerab remains legal; Knudsen 1999, Khan and Khan, n. d.), increased access to the area through the Karakoram Highway is believed to have increase poaching pressure (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/> <br/> Unlike in Mongolia, domestic livestock herds in the Russian Altai were reported as having declined during the 1990s (Paltsyn 2001), providing a potential opportunity for expansion of the protected area network in the Altai-Sayan area. <br/> <br/> In Tajikistan competition with livestock and harvesting of the subshrub teresken <em>Krascheninnikovia ceratoides</em> affect argali habitat. Poaching is the limiting factor in many areas except few hunting concessions, community-based game management areas and remotest regions (Michel and Muratov 2010; Michel and Rosen 2016). Projected climate change is predicted to cause shifts in the habitat available for argali (Salas <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/> <br/> In Uzbekistan, poaching represents the main threat facing Severtzov’s argali, which continues to occur even within protected area (N. Beshko pers. comm.). The second major threat to Severtzov’s argali is a loss of habitat and competition with domestic livestock for forage. Finally, inbreeding and harsh climatic conditions represent threats for the very small, isolated populations in the Aktau, Tamdytau, and Malguzar Mountains (N. Beshko pers. comm.).</p>","<p>Deriving a global population size from the available data is challenging. Numbers provided in CMS (2014) suggested a total number of about 107,000 argali, but our population information suggests a substantially lower number. Available figures are of varying reliability and refer to different spatial and temporal scales. Apparent increases in numbers are likely due mainly to more intensive surveys. Area-specific reports suggest locally stable or increasing population sizes, but over large areas trends of decline.</p>  <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> In the early 1970s, Petocz <em>et al</em>. (1978) accounted for approximately 1,260 argali in the Pamirs (including both Big and Little Pamir segments), from which they estimated a total abundance of about 2,500. During their survey in autumn 2004 (primarily of the Little Pamir), Schaller and Kang (2008) tallied 624 argali (87% of which were in the Little Pamir), and speculated that the total number might be 1,000. Some of the argali tallied in the Little Pamir may periodically cross into Tajikistan, and thus possibly be counted within surveys there. Harris and Winnie (2008) estimated that they observed 120-210 individual argali in the western segment of the Big Pamir in November-December 2007. Harris et al. (2010) used DNA microsatellites extracted from fecal samples collected in 2007 for a refined population estimate in the Big Pamir (northern slopes of Wakhan Range), yielding 172 (CI= 113-132) female and 249 (CI = 50-448) males. They consider the male estimate likely biased possibly because of movements in and out of the study area. They report further 106–191 male argali (no female) directly observed in Waghjir Valley in 2007. Observations in the border areas of Tajikistan (A. Bekmurodi, pers. comm. 2009, Kh. Karimov, pers. comm 2015) suggest that seasonally several thousand argali may inhabit the near border areas in the eastern Big Pamir and in the Little Pamir.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Wang <em>et al</em>. (1997) put forward estimates of 29,000-36,000 for <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em> alone (in Tibet, Qinghai, and southeastern Xinjiang); although Wang (1998) subsequently wrote that such an estimate was probably a “significant overestimate”), with an additional 2,100-2,800 <em>O. a. darwini</em> (in Inner Mongolia), 600-700 <em>O. a. jubata</em> (in Inner Mongolia), 8,000-11,000 <em>O. a. karelini</em> (in the Tian Shan), 2,000-3,000 <em>O. a. polii</em> (in the Pamirs), and some additional <em>O. a. ammon</em> (in northern Xinjiang near the Mongolia border). This would suggest an estimate during the early 1990s of 41,700-53,500 argali in China. Later, as part of a nationwide attempt to generate numerical estimates for wildlife, Yu estimated the total number of argali in China to be between 23,298 and 31,910 (Yu Yuqun, Northwest Institute of Endangered Species, Xian, personal communication, 2004). Both of these estimates were extrapolations based on density estimates from limited areas, and neither was associated with sufficient explanation to assess their accuracy. Given the tendency for density estimates to be taken from areas known to have the densest concentrations and to use models that are usually biased high (Harris and Burnham 2001); these estimates are more likely to be biased high than low. <br/> <br/> On the Tibetan plateau, Schaller (1998) considered that “…the total number of Tibetan argalis could be as low as 7,000”. For the Tibetan Autonomous Region, Liu and Yin (1993) estimated 5,000 argali. For Gansu, in a letter to the US Fish and Wildlife Service dated May 17, 1991, Wang Zhangyun of China’s CITES Management Office suggested that there were as many as 20,000 argali in this province alone. In Qinghai, Zheng (2003) estimated a total population for Qinghai of 3,588. Earlier, Zheng and Zhu (1990) had estimated a population size of 665 (with a 95% confidence interval of 245) within selected study sites totaling approximately 600 km² of the Bu’erhanbuda Shan portion of the Kunlun Shan (based on 18 groups observed). Harris (2010) suggested that argali on the Tibetan plateau might be much less abundant than official numbers suggest and are likely declining.<br/> <br/> There are at least four written estimates of argali abundance in the Hashiha’er International Hunting Area of Gansu encompassing the northern slopes of the Danghenan Shan and the nearby Yemanan Shan in Subei County, Gansu. A provincial survey from 1990 estimated 1,452 argali (with unspecified confidence limits of 831-2,073; Gao Jun, Gansu Wildlife Protection Bureau, Lanzhou, unpublished data), an internal report of unclear origin estimated 1,525 (with confidence limits of 990—2,060; Zhao Lianghong, Subei International Hunting Area, unpublished data), Liu <em>et al</em>. (2000) cited a mean density figure of 0.482 (which is higher than either of the 2 density estimates underlying the above abundance estimates, and which equates to an abundance estimate of 4,479), and Liu (2001) estimated a population of 3,294 within Yanchiwan township (which roughly equates with the Hashiha’er hunting area boundary). All of these estimates relied on some variation of ground-based distance sampling, but in no case were sampling methods described, although Liu (2001) revealed that his density estimate was based on a sample size of 6, and the total number of animals observed was 60. A brief survey in April 1999 suggested that all these estimates were biased high (R. Harris, unpublished data). In an adjacent hunting area in Aksai county, Gansu, the 1990 provincial population estimate was 1,545 (with confidence limits of 1,127—1,963; Gao Jun, unpublished data), and the density estimate from Liu <em>et al</em>. (2000) suggested a population size of 3,879. In contrast, ~ 1-month-long surveys in both 2000 and 2003 with KIHA staff, focusing on what was believed to be the best argali habitat, documented 204-255 individual argali, and although some were no doubt missed, Harris <em>et al</em>. (2005) concluded that it was highly unlikely that the total population exceeded 500. </p>  Harris <em>et al</em>. (2009) found argali within Inner Mongolia appear to be restricted to extremely small populations (likely below 200 in total) and the future of argali there appears tenuous, most likely dependent on the ability of dispersing individuals from Mongolia to supplement existing groups or colonize new areas, although very little habitat capable of sustaining argali populations remains within Inner Mongolia.<br/> <br/> In Xinjiang, no estimates are available specifically for the Tian Shan or Altai Mountains (although estimates for the former are in the thousands, for the latter in the hundreds). In Taxkorgan County where Xinjiang shares the Pamir range with Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Schaller <em>et al</em>. (1987) documented only 87 argali and believed the population to be rather small. However, a later survey (Schaller and Kang 2008) yielded documentation of 851 argali in the Taxkorgan Nature Reserve and 1,448 argali north of it. In a separate survey during the same year (2005), Gong <em>et al</em>. (2007) surveyed selected drainages within Taxkorgan Nature Reserve, tallying 433 argali. Based on the area sampled and assumptions about suitable habitat, they extrapolated an estimate of 1,500-1,700 argali within the Reserve. No population estimates are available for argali in Inner Mongolia, but most populations appear to be isolated and small (Wang and Schaller 1996, Bu <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wang 1998). <br/> <br/> Due to the lacking of consistent trend monitoring, population trends in China are largely unknown. A population monitored periodically over 12 years in Yeniugou, in the Kunlun Mountains south of Golmud in Qinghai apparently declined (Harris and Loggers 2004). No marked difference in abundance was noted in a population monitored in Aksai, Qilian Mountains in Gansu (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2005). Surveys by the Wildlife Conservation Society in 2008-2009 found argali sparse on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and local reports of a decline in numbers, despite a lack of poaching (A. Kang, in lit. 2013, quoted in CMS 2014). We could find no more recent information for China.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Fox and Johnsingh (1997) estimated that about 200 argali remained in Ladakh. Namgail (2004) counted 127 in a ~500 km² study area in the Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary and adjacent Tsokar Basin in spring 2003. Adding unpublished recent reports of an additional 120-140 argali elsewhere in Ladakh, he concluded that there might be slightly more than 200 argali in the Ladakh. Namgail (2004) cautioned against interpreting these later numbers as an increase of the 200 estimated earlier by Fox and Johnsingh (1997). Namgail <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated 300–360 <em>O. a. hodgsoni </em>in Ladakh. Singh (2008) estimated 480–620 individuals in eight widely spaced locations in Ladakh. Argali occur in very small parts of northern Sikkim along the border between India and China, (Tibet Autonomous Region), with an estimated 177 animals (Sharma and Lachungpa 2003, Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010). In the Western Himalaya, a few individuals occasionally move into the Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh from adjacent Ladakh (Pandey 2003; Devender Chauhan, Range Officer, pers. comm. 2017, Khanyari <em>et al</em>. 2019) and an unknown, but possibly large population, may exist in the adjacent Tsarap Chu catchment (Abhishek Ghoshal, pers. comm, 2018).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> In the western parts of the Kazakhstan plateau (Ulytau Mountains) the argali population was extirpated in the 1950s-1960s and will most probably not recover without external intervention (Berber 2007). Fedosenko (1999b) reported that Smirnov (1965, not seen) had estimated 16,000 argali in Karaganda during the early 1960s, but that later estimates in the 1970s and 1980s had put the number at 7,000 or even 5,000. A helicopter survey in November 1991 resulted in an estimate of 9,717 Karaganda argali, but whether this was a direct count or an extrapolation was not made clear by Fedosenko (1999b). Fedosenko (1999b) quotes R. Baidavletov as assuming a total abundance of 13,500 in the Karaganda area, including 6,500 in Karaganda oblast, 2,100 in Semipalatinsk oblast, 4,300 and the remainder in other oblasts as of the early 1990s. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) guessed 8,000 to 10,000 in the northeastern distribution (<em>O. a. collium</em>), i.e., the Karaganda area, with perhaps 250 in the Kara Tau Mountains (<em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>), and an unknown number in the West Tian Shan (<em>O. a. karelini</em>). Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2003) report tallying 449 individuals within a survey area of 1,544 km² in the upper course of the Baralbas River of Karaganda and Semipalatnisk, but declined to extrapolate this figure to areas not surveyed. The developed age pyramid of the surveyed population shows that the percentage of males decreases drastically starting from the age of 3 years. Surveys after 2000 revealed a disappointing picture of argali status (A. Subbotin, pers. comm. 2008). Uncontrolled killing by those who carry firearms appeared to be common; local militia and customs officials had come to areas inhabited by argali and killed dozens with gun-machines. In the Kara-Tau Mountains, Shakula (2000) believed that the population could have been as low as 100 animals. Surveys in fall 2018 (Shaymukhambetov <em>et al</em>. 2018) yielded records of 925 argali (1.27/km² surveyed area) in Severo-Vostochnoe Game Management Area (GMA) in northern Karaganda Province, 141 (0.45/km²) in Naryn GMA in the Tarbagatay and 279 (1.09/km²) in Zaysanskoe GMA in the Saur Range (both East-Kazakhstan Region). CMS (2014) presented population estimates of argali in Kazakhstan based on annual aerial surveys (latest data from spring 2013): 163 <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>; 1,743 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, and 10,859 <em>O. a. collium</em>, and only about 10 <em>O. a. ammon</em>. Total number of argali in Kazakhstan (total for all subspecies) increased from 8,525 in 2005 to 12,775 in 2013. Official data (A. Muzbay, pers. comm. 2019) report an increase to 15,300 argali across Kazakhstan by 2017: 12, 300 <em>O. a. collium</em>. 2,500 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, 480 <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em> and 10 <em>O. a. ammon</em>. A. Berber (personal comm. 2011) confirmed an overall growth of the population of <em>O. a. collium</em> and its distribution range is expanding, but official data also suggest recoveries of <em>O. a. karelini</em> and <em>O. a. nigrimontana (</em>A. Muzbay, pers. comm. 2019<em>)</em>. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> There is little consensus regarding the abundance of argali in Kyrgyzstan. According to Fedosenko (1999b), aerial surveys conducted during winters 1990 and 1991 tallied 5,493 argali, and estimated a total population of approximately 8,000 in the early 1990s. Luschekina (1994) counted 565 individuals in the western part of the Kokshalatau range in summer 1993. Based on these counts plus older, unpublished counts, she extrapolated an estimate of 6,000 argali in northeastern Kyrgyzstan. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) reported “no more than 2,000” argali in Tian Shan (which may have included parts of Kazakhstan), and estimates of from 9,900 to 16,000 in the Pamir and Tian Shan of <em>O.a. polii</em> subspecies (which included parts of Tajikistan). Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) believed argali in both the Tian Shan and Pamirs were declining. Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2003) surveyed 190 km of transects in a similar area during spring 2002, tallying 717 argali. Largescale surveys in key argali habitats across the country carried out in December 2010 and May 2011 tallied a total of 15,311 <em>O. a. karelini</em> and <em>O. a. polii</em> in the Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas regions and 37 <em>O. a. severtzovi</em> in Batken (Davletbakov and Musaev 2012). In Kyrgyzstan, official numbers for the years 2002 – 2017 vary between 12,000 in 2007 and 21,500 in 2013, with inconsistent numbers that very well beyond feasible population fluctuations (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019). The most recent official figure was 16,669 argalis in 2017 (12,628 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, 4,013 <em>O. a. poli</em>i and 28 <em>O. a. severtzovi</em>). Abundance varies greatly. Some hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) have high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> The Mongolian Academy of Sciences has conducted a few country-wide surveys; however, the methods used do not permit accurate population estimation. Alternatively, they do provide some measure of population trends because similar methods were used. The methods involved several teams of biologists driving and hiking in areas known to at least historically contain populations of argali sheep and discussions with local people and local government officials in these areas. These surveys yielded round number estimates (lacking measures of precision) of 40,000 in 1970, 50,000 in 1975, 60,000 in 1985, and between 13,000-15,000 in 2001 (Dulamtseren 1970; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b; Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006; Mongolian Academy of Sciences, unpubl. Data). Reading <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested that no more than 20,000 argali inhabited Mongolia in 1994. The 2001 Academy of Sciences survey suggested that approximately 10,000 – 12,000 argali inhabited the Gobi Region of Mongolia (roughly corresponding to the range of <em>O. a. darwini</em>) and 3,000 – 5,000 argali inhabited the Altai Region (roughly the range of <em>O. a. ammon</em> in Mongolia). The most recent nationwide and local data were produced by a survey conducted in autumn 2009. Field teams sampled a total of 134 argali distribution units within Mongolia, which are estimated to occupy approximately 46,603 km² of the total area of 60,237 km² that was previously mapped as occupied by argali. They observed 385 groups of argali, totaling 3,373 individuals and estimated the argali population at 19,701 (95% confidence limits 9,193–43,135). However, post-survey concerns about sampling in some aimags (provinces) and estimates derived previously allowed adjustments that resulted in the best single estimate for Mongolia being 17,903 argali. Direct comparisons are difficult because previous survey reports lacked details of the areas visited, field methods, and analysis. Apparent increases or decreases in each aimag may be real, or may have been caused by differences in methods (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2010). Another survey in 2009 produced an estimate 26,155, reportedly an increase of almost 30 percent since a similar survey in 2002 (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is difficult to conclude trends from these figures given the differences in methods and coverage, but on regional distribution data, it does appear that argali continue to decline in western and central Mongolia, while populations in eastern Mongolia appear to be expanding. Argali populations in southern Mongolia appear to be relatively stable. By opinion of S. Amgalanbaatar (pers. comm. 2019) the overall population is declining slowly, despite some increases in a few populations (such as in the southeast Gobi region). Probably no more than a few thousand Altai argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em>) persist in Mongolia, while several thousand Gobi argali (the putative <em>O. a. darwini</em>) inhabit a growing range in the south and east.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Nepal</strong><br/> No estimates of the number of argali in Nepal exist; it is likely to be a small number (Shrestha <em>et al</em> 2005) , possibly in the lower 10s (K. Suryawansi, pers. comm. 2020).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Pakistan</strong><br/> Animals (<em>O. a. polii</em>) using the Khunjerab area of Pakistan may also use the Chinese side; the number of animals occurring in Pakistan remains unknown, but is likely to be small, possibly less than 100 (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997). In 2002 or 2003, Khan and Khan (n.d.) report observing 34 argali. Ali <em>et al</em>. (2017) observed a herd of 19 individuals in Karachanai Nallah, in Khunjerab National Park, in 2012. Haider <em>et al</em>. (2018) report numbers of immigrant argali in Pakistan from 1992 till 2012 varying between 31 and 168 with a declining trend the most recent figure being 41 in 2012. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> In the mid-1990s, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) estimated that between 450-700 argali occurred in the Altai Mountains of southern Russia, distributed among numerous subpopulations none of which exceed 50 animals. Paltsyn (2001) reports counts of 80-85 argali within Altaisky Zapovednik (speculating that 100-110 individuals may have existed), 150-160 in headwaters of rivers of Sailugem Ridge (south of the Zapovednik, near the Mongolian border), and 40-45 individuals along the slopes of Chikhachev’s Ridge in the Tuvan Republic. A. Subbotin (in litt.) mentioned surveys of <em>O. a. ammon</em> conducted in the Altai Republic and in the Tuva Republic in 2010, during which in total about 700 argali were recorded in the Russian Federation, with 448 in the Saylyugem Range; the overall population in Altai Republic alone was estimated at 550–600 animals (CMS 2014). In 2019 WWF Russia and WWF Mongolia jointly estimated that the Russian-Mongolian transboundary population comprised of 4,851 argali with 1,431 sheep found in Russia (1,314 in the Republic of Altai, 117 in the Republic of Tyva) and 3,420 in Mongolia, suggesting a slight increase since the last survey in 2017 (WWF 2019). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Numerous figures have been put forward for the total number of argali in Tajikistan but methodological problems make comparison and establishment of trends difficult. Luschekina (1994) reported that helicopter surveys conducted in 1991 tallied 9,415 animals, with the estimated total in Tajikistan being 9,900-10,300. Density was highest in the eastern-most section, near the border with China where a border fence limited human access. Fedosenko (1999a), based on local information in the Saluistyk River area, believed this estimate to be slightly low, asserting that population size in the early 1990s was 11,500-12,000. Based on poaching records and political events within Tajikistan at the time, Fedosenko (1999a) hypothesized a decline to about 9,500-10,000 during the mid-1990s. Fedosenko (1999a) reported tallying 4,948 argali in southeastern portions of Tajikistan in 1999 where he had tallied only 1,242 in 1995, and concluded that the population in Tajikistan had increased to 13,000-14,000. Other estimates during the 1990s by K. Kasirov (quoted by Schaller 2003) were in the 8,000-9,000 range. Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2002, 2003) surveyed 900 km of transects during late February and early March 2002 in southeastern Tajikistan, estimating that they tallied 5,951 individual argali. Extrapolations from these counts (based on poorly documented assumptions) yielded an estimate of 14,500 argali within southern and eastern study areas, and 39,900 for all of Tajikistan (their surveys evidently took place where Lushchekina (1994) and Fedosenko (1999a) had earlier postulated this highest densities in Tajikistan). Schaller and Kang (2008) tallied 1,528 argali in summer 2003 within selected census blocks totaling 1,977 km² (and in winter 2005, counted 2,200 animals within their South Alichur block in Murgab). Schaller and Kang (2008) declined to project an estimate for all of Tajikistan, but believed that the 13,000-14,000 estimated by Fedosenko (1999a) was “of the correct order of magnitude”. During a survey covering 8,170 km² in the Eastern Pamirs in December 2009 a total of 23,711 argali in 510 herds were recorded with maximum herd size of 1,100, but varying densities with some large aggregations of argali contrasting with vast empty areas of suitable habitat (Michel and Muratov 2010). A part of the survey area where about 2,200 argali had been recorded has since been transferred from Tajikistan to China (Bitabarova 2015). Valdez <em>et al.</em> (2015) reported a slight decline in numbers from 8,649, 8,392, and 7,663 observed in the southeastern Pamirs during winter surveys in 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012 with densities of 5.42, 4.91 and 4.49 argalis/km², respectively, but suggested that differences in numbers observed were probably due principally to differing dates of surveys among years. <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>may still number around a few dozen animals along the borders with Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan (Sharufiddinov, Rahimov, pers. comm. to S. Michel 2008; Rahimov and Amirov 2011), but in the upper Zerafshan Valley search in 2018 and 2019 did not yield any records (unpublished data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Uzbekistan</strong><br/> The Nuratau Strictly Protected Area in the Nuratau Mountains Range hosts the largest population of <em>O. a. severttzovi</em> with estimated about 1,200-2,500 animals (direct observations of 500 – 1,150 animals) during 1994 - 2018. The numbers fluctuate but appear to be overall stable, with a slightly declining trend (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019). Outside of the protected area, the Nuratau Mountains supports few argali, most of them in the western sections of Nuratau Mountain Range and very few and only irregularly in the eastern Nuratau and Koitash ranges. No population estimates are available. Probably less than 100 argali remain in the Aktau Range. In the Tamdytau Mountains in the central Kyzylkum Desert Gritsyna <em>et al</em>. (2015) confirmed the presence of argali and captured with camera traps nine individuals, including adult males, females and lambs. The number of argali in Zaamin Strictly Protected Area in the Turkestan Range at the border with Tajikistan is not known. Further a few individuals may persist in the Malguzar Range near the Zaaminsk SPA. Therefore, a total of less than 2,000 Severtzov argali persist in Uzbekistan, of which 90% occur in the Nuratau Range (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019).",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in northeastern Afghanistan, China (Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, possibly western Sichuan, Tibet, and Xinjiang), northern India (Ladakh and Sikkim), eastern Kazakhstan, eastern Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, northern Nepal (near the Chinese border), extreme northern Pakistan, Russia (Tuvan and Altai Republics in the Altai Mountains), eastern Uzbekistan, and eastern Tajikistan (Fedosenko and Blank 2005). There are no recent records of argali occurrence in Bhutan (Tschewang Wangchuck, pers. comm. 2008). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> Argali were historically present in much of the Afghan Pamirs of the Wakhan district (Habibi 1977, Petocz 1973, Petocz <em>et al</em>. 1978), but were not known from elsewhere in Afghanistan during recent times. They currently occupy the western section of the Big Pamirs and adjacent parts of the Wakhan Range, most of the Little Pamirs, and are often found in the Waghjir Valley as well (Harris and Winnie 2008, Schaller and Kang 2008). They are also present in the eastern portion of the Big Pamir and are currently known to be transboundary with Tajikistan (Luikart <em>et al</em>. 2011). They are occasionally reported from elsewhere within the upper Wakhan Corridor. These animals are considered to be <em>O. a. polii</em>.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Argali are distributed in most mountain ranges of Xinjiang (Yu <em>et al</em>. 1999), including the Altai Shan, Arjin Shan, Kara-Kunlun Shan, Pamirs, and Tian Shan and associated ranges. Some authorities consider all these argali except those in the Pamirs to be <em>O. a. karelini</em>; others sub-divide these into other subspecies. Within the ranges of the Tibetan Plateau, argali are distributed discontinuously and irregularly (Liu and Yin 1993; Schaller 1998; Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2007; Harris 2007). Although present in ranges from the Himalaya to the Qilian Shan in Gansu, argali on the Tibetan Plateau appear to be rare where temperatures are exceedingly low, winter snows deep, and/or precipitation amounts too low to support grass (Harris 2007). However, relatively healthy populations occur in the Qilian and Kunlun Mountains of Gansu and Qinghai (although from written accounts, argali are rare in the drier, western portions of the Kunlun Shan (Feng 1990; G. Schaller, unpublished data 2001)). Chinese sources report the species as present in extreme western Sichuan (Wang 2002) but recent documentation of this is weak. Most authors consider argali on the Tibetan Plateau (including the Qilian Shan in Gansu) <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>, although some Chinese authors consider <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em> limited to southern Tibet, and consider argali north of that to be <em>O. a. dalailamae</em>. Argali are patchily distributed in Inner Mongolia (Bu <em>et al</em>. 1998), but Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) found that argali have been lost from at least two areas considered to contain remnant populations during the 1990s by Wang and Schaller (1996): the Helan Shan and the Lang Shan mountain ranges. Disturbance and habitat degradation in a 3rd area, the Mazong Shan range, has likely caused the disappearance of argali there as well; small numbers of argali persist in the Yabrai (Yubulai) Shan range, the Hada Shan area and the Erenuo’ersumu region of Sunitezuo Banner. They are historically known from parts of Shaanxi and Ningxia Provinces (in the Helan Shan, which forms Ningxia’s western border with Inner Mongolia), but recent records suggest that they no longer occur in either of these provinces (Liu Zhensheng, Gong Minghao pers. comm., 2008). These animals are variously described as <em>O. a. darwini</em> or <em>O. a. jubata</em>. Harris <em>et al</em>. (2009) believe that <em>O. a. jubata</em>, as a subspecies with unique adaptations, has become extirpated and they did not know of any credible reports of argali from south of the Yellow River within recent historical times. Argali have long been extirpated from the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Within India, argali are restricted to the eastern plateau of Ladakh and Hemis National Park in Central Ladakh. There are occasional reports of one-two individuals moving into the neighboring area in Spiti (Himachal Pradesh) (Khanyari <em>et al</em>. 2019), and, separately, in northern Sikkim adjacent to Tibet (Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010). Indian biologists consider these animals <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>. In Ladakh potential argali habitat was estimated at ca. 11,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Chundawat and Qureshi 1999), however much of it remained unoccupied (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk 2001). Key sites with argali in Ladakh included the Tso Kar basin, near Chumur, Kharnak, Phobrang and in the upper Indus Valley (near Skagzung), with very small populations scattered elsewhere (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk 2001, Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2009). A few individuals are known to occasionally visit the Kibber area of Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, while relatively large populations are also likely in the Tsarap Chu region of Himachal (Abhishek Ghoshal, pers. comm, 2019). The Tso Lhamo plateau is a relatively small area in the northern part of Sikkim but harbours a fairly large population of argali (Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> In Kazakhstan, argali (usually considered <em>O.a. collium</em>) are present in the central Kazakhstan Low Hills (<em>Melkosopochnik</em>) and in the Tarbagatay and Saur in the northeastern part of the country at the border with China. Wang (1998) listed the argali on the Chinese side of the border adjacent to the range of <em>O. a collium</em> in Kazakhstan as <em>O. a. karelini</em>. Small populations are also present in the Kara-Tau Mountains (<em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>, although Shakula (2000) raised doubts about the validity of this subspecies), and (<em>O. a. karelini</em>) in the ranges of the western (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997) and northern Tian Shan (CMS 2014). Some experts believe <em>O. severtzovi</em> has been extirpated from Kazakhstan (N. Beshko, pers. comm.). Ishunin (1970) wrote that the subspecies historically inhabited the Beltau Mountains and eastern portions of the Aktau range. But the location of the Beltau makes such occurrence unlikely, while all mountain ranges with the name “Aktau” within the potential range area are currently entirely in Uzbekistan. In the Soviet Union in the 1950s, the borders between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were modified and range area and available habitat suggest that Severtzov argali never occurred on the territories nowadays belonging to Kazakhstan, but possibly in areas transferred to Uzbekistan.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> In Kyrgyzstan, argali are present in the southeastern and eastern quarter of the country toward the Chinese border from Kazakhstan in the north to Tajikistan in the south, as well as along portions of the western Tian Shan toward the Uzbek border (Fedosenko and Blank 2005) and the northern Tien Shan along the border with Kazakhstan. Animals in southern and southeastern Kyrgyzstan are usually considered <em>O. a. polii</em>; some authorities consider those in northern Kyrgyzstan <em>O. a. karelini</em>, but geographic and morphological separation remains unclear, with often the Naryn River taken as boundary between the range areas of the subspecies. Kashkarov (2010) suggested that the Fergana Range may divide the two subspecies. Davletbakov (pers. comm. 2014) suggests that the Alay Valley in the south of Kyrgyzstan is the most substantial natural barrier limiting connectivity between argali populations and that argali north of the Alay Valley more likely belong to <em>O. a. karelini. </em>In the Southwest of the country, on the northern slope of the Turkestan Range of the Pamir Alay System, in Batken Region, argali skulls have been collected in 2007 and 2013 (collector A. N. Ostashchenko) which resemble <em>O. a. severtzovi</em>. In May 2011 Severtzov Argali have been observed in Batken region (Davletbakov and Musaev 2012).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> Argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em> and <em>O. a. darwini</em>) are distributed widely, but patchily across a large portion of Mongolia. Historically, argali occurred in disjunct populations across all, but eastern Mongolia, in areas with rolling hills, mountains, rocky outcrops, canyons, and plateaus (Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, 2003; Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). Argali appeared to be expanding their distribution in eastern Mongolia, but contracting and becoming even more fragmented in western Mongolia (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Large areas formerly occupied by argali in western Mongolia now lack the species. The species’ current distribution includes portions of the Altai, Trans-Alai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, Khentie, and Khovsgol Mountain ranges, as well as isolated areas in the Gobi Desert (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). More specifically, isolated populations exist in the mountains of the Mongolian Altai and Gobi Altai Mountains, primarily the western and southern Khangai Mountains, near the source of the Arsain River in the Khovsgol Mountains, and the southernmost Khentii Mountains. Other populations persist patchily in the Dzungarian Gobi, Great Gobi, Trans-Altai Gobi, Alashan Gobi, Middle Gobi, and eastern Gobi (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1970; Sokolov and Orlov 1980; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2001; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b; Fedosenko and Blank 2005; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006)).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Nepal</strong><br/> Argali (usually considered <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>) are known from the Damodar Kunda area of Mustang District, bordering Tibet (Shrestha <em>et al</em>. 2005). They may also persist in the Dolpo region, north of the Dhualagiri Range (Wegge and Oli 1997). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Pakistan</strong><br/> Argali in Pakistan (considered <em>O. a. polii</em>) are known only from Khunjerab National Park (KNP) and environs, including the Khunerab, Kilik and Mintaka passes with China (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997, Haider<em> et al. </em>2018, Khan and Khan n.d.). In Pakistan, argali now occurs only in one small watershed, in Khunjerab National Park, bordering China, which animals visit sporadically during summer (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2017). The visitation showed drastic decline over 20 years, possibly due to fencing at the Sino-Pakistan border and dietary competition with wild herbivores (Haider <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is unknown whether argali also use the mountains separating these areas from Afghanistan’s Little Pamir to the northwest. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> Argali (considered <em>O. a. ammon</em>) were formerly found in Zabaikal, Kuray, and the South-Chuya ranges and the Ukok plateau (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). More recently, they are known only from Tuva and Altai Republics (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997; Paltsyn 2001; Maroney 2004; Paltsyn <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Argali (<em>O. a. polii)</em> are present through most of the eastern third of Tajikistan (Lushchekina 1994, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997, Schaller and Kang 2008, Michel and Muratov 2010), from the border with Xinjiang, China, in the south along the border with Afghanistan west to Langar, in the center west to Sarez Lake, and along the border with Kyrgyzstan west to Altyn Mazar. In the northwest of the country, <a name=""move35410035"">Severtzov argali <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>have been documented by skulls and reports from local people in 2011 and by direct observations in 2014 (data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project) </a>on the southern slopes of western Turkestan Range near the border with Uzbekistan and in the upper Zerafshan Valley in both, Turkestan and Zerafshan ranges. <a name=""move354100351"">Severtzov argali <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>have been documented by skulls and reports from local people in 2011 and by direct observations in 2014 (data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project). </a>In the western Turkestan Range in fall 2015 an argali ram was captured in fall 2018 (Michel, pers. comm. by Zerafshan National Park ranger 2018) and a hunting outfitter advertised in social media an alleged Severtzov argali killed from Tajikistan in February 2015. Searches in 2018 and 2019 in the upper Zerafshan Valley did not yield any records and argalis are possibly extirpated there now (unpublished data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project).<br/> <br/><u> Uzbekistan</u><br/> <em>O. ammon severtzovi</em> was previously distributed over a wide area of Uzbekistan from the northeastern part of the Pamiro-Alaya mountain range thoughout the low mountains of the Kyzylkum Desert. Historically, it occupied the mountains of Nuratau, Aktau, Koytash, Malguzar and Turkenstan Range as well as Pistalitau, Tamdytau, Bukantua, Kuldjuktau, and other low ranges in the Kyzylkum Desert (Ishunin 1970; N. Beshko, pers. comm.). Today, the majority of animals are restricted to the Nuratau Range, primarily within the Nuratau Strictly Protected Area and a small population in the western part of this mountain range (N. Beshko pers. comm. 2019). Very small populations persist (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019) in the Turkestan, western Aktau, Tamdytau (confirmed by Grytsina <em>et al</em>. 2015), and possibly Malguzar ranges, but not any more permanently in the Koytash Mountains. Previously, <em>O. a. karelini</em> also occurred in the western Tien Shan in Uzbekistan, but no records are known for the last several decades (S. Zagrebin, pers. comm. 2018). </p>",,Terrestrial,"Argali are included on Appendix II of CITES (since 2019 each subspecies as a separate species <em>O. ammon</em>, <em>O. collium</em>, <em>O. darwini</em>, <em>O. jubata</em>, <em>O. karelini</em>, <em>O. polii</em> and <em>O. severtzovi</em>), except the subspecies <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em> and <em>O. a. hodgsonii</em>, which are included on Appendix I as the species <em>O. hodgsoni</em> and <em>O. nigrimontana</em>. The United States Endangered Species Act lists argali as endangered, except in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, where they are listed as threatened. (Threatened classification allows for importation of trophies from legally taken argali in those countries under specifically-authorized permits from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Permits for importation of trophies are generally not authorized for taxa listed as Endangered).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> A trophy hunting program for argali in the Big Pamir operated from ~ 1966-1978, but was discontinued following the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and to date, has not been re-established. Under this program, livestock grazing in high elevation habitats favoured by argali during summer was effectively prohibited, and poaching by local pastoralists reduced. However, domestic livestock grazing was concentrated on argali winter ranges, with the result that the overall effect on argali habitat of the hunting program was unclear (Petocz <em>et al</em>. 1978). All hunting in Afghanistan was banned by order of President in 2006. In addition, argali is specifically listed as a protected species under Article 47 of the Environment Law of 2007. There do not, however, appear to be serious effort so to enforce the ban. In 2009, argali were officially-listed as a Protected Species in Afghanistan, strictly prohibiting all hunting and trading of this species within the country. The distribution of argali in Afghanistan is entirely within the Wakhan National Park, established in 2014. The national park allows for the continuation of pastoral land use.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Argali are classified as a Category II “key species” under the Chinese National Wildlife Law of 1988. As such, permits to take argali must be obtained from province-level authorities. In practice, only the trophy hunting programs have procured permits to take argali under this legislation (Harris 2007). <br/> <br/> Argali occur in a number of Chinese nature reserves. In Xinjiang, they occur in at least six nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Arjin Shan, Kalamaili, Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), West Tian Shan, Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). On the Tibetan Plateau, argali occur in the 247,120 km² Qiangtang Reserve in Tibet and the 83,000 km² Kekexili Reserve in Qinghai, as well as in scattered populations within the Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve in Qinghai (Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Gansu, argali occur in Yanchiwan Nature Reserve, and may occur in the Qilian Nature Reserve. Nature reserve designation in China does not necessarily preclude habitat conflicts, as grazing, mining, and other activities often take place.<br/> <br/> A number of trophy hunting areas have been established with argali as the focal species. Hunting areas in Xinjiang include Baicheng, Bu’erjin, Fuyun, Hami, Hejing, Qiemo, Tacheng, Tashiku’ergan, and Tulufan counties; in Gansu in Aksai and Subei counties (Subei’s consisted of two distinct areas, the Hashiha’er area in the Qilian Mountains and the Mazong Shan area in the Gobi Desert abutting Mongolia). In addition, two hunting areas in Qinghai Province, focusing primarily on blue sheep, have argali populations: Dulan (within separate townships, Balong and Gouli) and Maduo counties. One hunting area in Inner Mongolia (Yabulei) contains argali. Hunting areas in China have generally succeeded in reducing poaching and in generating some local enthusiasm for argali, but have not yet succeeded in treating habitat conflicts (Harris and Pletscher 2002; Harris 2007). Since 2006, China has suspended argali trophy hunting. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Argali are listed under Schedule I (highest protection) of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) of the Government of India (Fox and Johnsingh 1997). Poaching appears to have declined in recent years (Namgail 2004), but has evidently not been accompanied by an increase in argali. Little seems to have been done to address the likely deleterious effects of displacement increasing numbers of livestock on argali in Ladakh. Argali are rare but present in Khangchengzonga National Park in Sikkim and the Tso Lhamo plateau, where there is some threat from yaks and other livestock (Sharma and Lachungpa 2003). Bhatnagar and Wangchuk (2001) felt that even though most of the argali range in Ladakh is protected under the Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary (ca. 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and part of the Hemis National Park (ca. 4,000km<sup>2</sup>), the small and fragmented populations may have poor chances of recovery in a scenario where livestock pressure persists. Recent surveys, however, point to recovery of argali in small pockets of eastern Ladakh that may be due to locally declining pastoral use by the nomads opting for alternative livelihoods (M. Khanyari, pers. comm, 2020). A positive development for all mountain areas in India is the implementation of a national landscape-level, participatory strategy called the Project Snow Leopard, which is bringing in better planning, training and funds for conservation of species in both protected and unprotected areas of the Himalaya.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> The species is listed in the Red Book and thereby legally protected from any take. Hunting permits are issued only by particular governmental decree following a special procedure, but there have been no legal hunts since 2003. Fedosenko (1999b) considered that some of the hunting concessions in Karaganda Oblast protected argali well. Between 1990 and 2000, 75 argali rams were shot in the Karaganda area, and the approximately $900,000 earned was used for scientific studies, according to Fedosenko (1999b). However, Fedosenko (1999b) also believed that trophy hunting was having deleterious effects on breeding behavior and resultant productivity of females, and recommended a reduction in the yearly offtake quota. Currently the lack of hunting options for argali is a disincentive to their protection and the conservation of their habitats (Shaymukhambetov <em>et al</em>. 2018). Trends in habitat conflicts with domestic livestock in Kazakhstan have not been well documented.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> Argali is listed in the Red Book of the Kyrgyz Republic and thus legally protected. Only a limited number of permits are issued annually to private hunting concessions (Michel and Rosen 2016). The Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area is the habitat of an argali population shared with adjacent hunting concessions.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> Argali sheep are protected as “Rare” under the 2001 revision (Mongolian Government Act No. 264) of the 2000 Mongolian Law on Animals (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). General hunting of argali has been prohibited since 1953, and is the species is further protected as “Rare” under the 1995 Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). Argali are included in Appendix II of CITES (UNEP-WCMC, 2006), with an export quota of 80 hunting trophies with horns and 44 skins and horns in 2005. Altai argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em>) were listed as Rare” in both the 1987 and 1997 Mongolian Red Books, and the species was upgraded to “Endangered” in Mongolia in the most recent nationwide assessment (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Approximately 14% of the species’ range in Mongolia occurs within federal protected areas, including Altai Taivan Bogd National Conservation Park (NCP), Gobi Gurvan Saikhan NCP, Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area (SPA) sections A and B, Ikh Nart NR, Khokh Serkh SPA, Khoredal Saridag SPA, Khustai Nuruu NCP, Myangan Ugalzat National Conservation Park, Siilkhem SPA, Tsagaan Shuvuut SPA, Tsambagarav SPA, and Turgen Uul SPA (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b). Small populations likely occur in other federal and provincial (aimag) or county (soum) protected areas as well.<br/> <br/> Although protected from general hunting, trophy hunters can purchase licenses. Under the Mongolian Hunting Fee Law of 1995, revenue generated from argali trophy hunting is divided among the federal government’s general funds (70%), the local province (20%), and the hunting organization (10%); specifically, US$ 18,000 for <em>O. a. ammon</em> trophies and US$ 9,000 for <em>O. a. darwini</em> trophies is allocated to local and federal governments (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). Ostensibly this money should benefit local people, government agencies, and help implement important conservation actions for argali and the ecosystems they inhabit, but unfortunately, little of this money makes it back to local people or to the conservation of the species (Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Wingard and Zahler 2006, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Indeed, because local governments generally receive no additional revenue from trophy hunting (the federal government simply reduces payments to local governments that receive trophy hunting permits), many local governments are actively establishing protected areas to prevent future hunting (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Recent reforms to Mongolian trophy hunting practices have led to proposals for community-based wildlife management programmes (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Initial efforts by WWF-Mongolia, the Argali Wildlife Research Center, Denver Zoological Foundation, and local governments stalled; however, after initiation of a Global Environment Facility Project in the region and no progress has been made in recent years. <br/> <br/> WWF and the Ministry of Nature and Environment organised a workshop on ‘Conservation of Argali in Mongolia’ in 2000 that resulted in a Argali Conservation Management Plan in 2002. However, this plan has not yet been adopted by the government and is not being implemented.<br/> <br/> Mongolia’s Argali Wildlife Research Centre, Denver Zoological Foundation, and Mongolian Academy of Sciences cooperate on a number of conservation and research projects, including an interdisciplinary research and conservation project in Ikh Nart Nature Reserve, Dornogobi Aimag in cooperation with the Dalanjargal Soum Administration. That work, begun in the late 1990s, has resulted in several publications (e.g., Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, 2003; Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2003, 2005, 2009; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b, 2006, 2012; Tserenbataa <em>et al</em>. 2004; Wingard 2005; Singh <em>et al</em>. 2010; Wingard <em>et al</em>. 2011a, 2011b; Bragin <em>et al</em>. 2017; Murdoch <em>et al</em>. 2017a, 2017b; Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2019), development of ecotourism to support conservation, a broad conservation education program, and active conservation management of the reserve by the Dalanjargal Soum Administration. <br/> <br/> Additional conservation measures are desperately required in Mongolia. Clark <em>et al</em>. (2006) outlined the following:<br/> <br/> • Implement the recommendations outlined in the Argali Conservation Management Plan, update the plan regularly and monitor its implementation, in particular in all hunting areas.<br/> • Improve enforcement of existing legislation that would help conserve argali. <br/> • Enhance conservation management in protected areas where argali are found at high population densities, and increase the capacity of protected areas personnel and other environmental law enforcement officers.<br/> • Work to improve the livelihoods of local communities in areas where argali are protected by local initiatives and re-initiate community-based approaches to argali conservation (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a).<br/> • Develop public education programmes to raise awareness of the status of and threats to the species. <br/> • Continue ecological research, monitor population trends, and study the impacts of threats, including work in the Altai and Khangai Mountains to complement research occurring in the Gobi Desert.<br/> • Implement the recommendations from the Mongolian Wildlife Trade Workshop as outlined in Wingard and Zahler (2006).<br/><br/> Major revisions to argali trophy hunting practices in Mongolia as outlined in Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. (2002a) and Reading and Amgalanbaatar (2016) could generate substantial revenue for conservation and ensure that local people benefit, greatly benefitting argali conservation. However, the barriers to changing the way trophy hunting is managed and implemented in Mongolia are formidable.  <br/> Pakistan<br/> Working with local people in the Khunjerab area toward mutually agreeable conservation solutions has been a contentious issue for many years. Successful resolution of competing claims with concerns for the interests of argali will ultimately be beneficial for conservation.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> Argali are listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, and hunting is legally banned; it is unclear how effective this legal protection is. Argali occur in the Altaisky Zapovednik, but most argali in the Russian Federation are outside of protected areas. Both Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) and Paltsyn (2001) suggested expanding the area under protected area status in the area. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested that the eastern portion of Sailguem Ridge near the Mongolian border could be a possible new protected area, as well as in the upper reaches of the Chagan-Burgazy River. Paltsyn (2001) noted that WWF has developed a long-term program to promote sustainable development in the Altai-Sayan region, which could have benefits for argali.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Argali occur in Pamir National Park (26,000 km²), and the Zorkul Zapovednik (870 km²), although neither protected area is fully functional (Schaller and Kang 2008). Argali have generally benefited from the substantial reduction in domestic livestock grazing in the high-elevation Pamirs following Tajikistan’s independence in 1991 (Fedosenko 1999a). Trophy hunting began in 1987, the same year that local hunting was prohibited (Fedosenko 1999b). Argali are legally protected and quotas for trophy hunts are issued by the Government, numbering 40-80/year (Schaller and Kang 2008, Michel and Rosen, 2016). There are reports that additional animals are sometimes sold beyond the official quotas. However, poaching, by pastoralists, military, and border guards have been major threats – in part due to the civil war of the mid 1990s – and continue to be in less extent. Protection from excessive human mortality and human disturbance appears to be well controlled by hunting concessions in the southeastern corner, somewhat less so in other portions of argali range (Schaller 2003). Trophy hunts represent a substantial source of revenue that could be used for argali conservation; this appears to be occurring in some hunting concessions within Tajikistan, but not in others (Schaller 2003, Michel and Rosen 2016). Since 2013 a community-based group developed game management area in the northern part of Alichur Pamir; revenues from hunting, tourism and conservation grants were used to prevent poaching and reduce livestock competition, resulting in an increase of argali numbers in this area. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Uzbekistan</strong><br/> Severtzov’s argali are protected with the Nuratau Strictly Protected Area and a few individuals possibly survive in the Zaamin Strictly Protected Area, which however due to its location in the border zone had been of limited effectiveness since the 1990s. The species is included in the Red Book of Uzbekistan and protected from general hunting, although limited trophy hunting is permitted and occurs irregularly with up to 5 permits per year. Unfortunately, little law enforcement to prevent poaching occurs outside of the protected areas. Support for anti-poaching and improvement of pasture use are crucial.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years), but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.</p>","<p>The Siberian Ibex&#160;primarily occupies mountainous regions from 500 to-5,500 m asl in rocky terrain and open alpine meadows and crags, seeking out lower elevations during the winter (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). In the completely snowed in valleys of the Himalaya, however, ibex remain in high elevations during winter to feed on emergent vegetation in the avalanche chutes and windblown crests, and also digging through softer snow of the higher elevations. They descend to the lower valley bottoms to take advantage of the spring thaw, but ascend to the highest ridgelines during the peak of summer (Schaller 1977, Bhatnagar 1997). Ibex occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. Siberian Ibex&#160;can also be found in areas with canyons, rocky outcrops, and steep ‘escape’ terrain far from high mountains (Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007, Peterson 2016, Bragin <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species rarely enters forest zones, but on a hot day does prefer shaded areas, or even small pockets of pastures near glaciers. Ibex tend to remain near steep, escape terrain (Bhatnagar 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Pin Valley National Park in India, over 90% of the over 800 ibex sightings were within 100 m from ‘escape terrain’ (Bhatnagar 1997). Females tend to retreat into the security of cliffs for parturition in May-June (Schaller 1977). </p>  <p>Ibex live in small groups that vary considerably in size, sometimes forming herds of over 100 animals, but more typically averaging 6-30 animals, depending on the region (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1997, 1999b; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Singh <em>et al. </em>2010). They spend the day in alternating periods of activity and rest, having a bimodal pattern through much of the year. In winter, ibex in the Himalaya tend to have a distinct unimodal activity peak towards noon, while resting on or near cliffs from evening until the next morning (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1992, Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). </p>  <p>Ibex shows little sexual segregation throughout the year, except the period between parturition (around June) and autumn (November) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex in an area of rocky outcrops in the Mongolian Gobi Desert displayed no segregation between sexes and similar sized mean annual home ranges using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) of 42 km<sup>2</sup> for females (n = 5) and 39 km<sup>2</sup> for males (n = 4) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study on ranging patterns of ibex in the Indian Himalaya (2 adult males and 3 females) shows that the mean annual home range (MCPs) of males (44 km<sup>2</sup>) was almost double that of females (20 km<sup>2</sup>) (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex used extremely small ranges on lower, south facing slopes with early sprout during the spring (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>), expanding to larger ranges in summer and autumn, but again confining to small ranges during winter (5-10 km<sup>2</sup>). Daily movements of ibex were highest during the summer flush when they traversed over a km during a day to take advantage of forage quality, but were confined to barely a 300-400 meters during winter and spring due to limited usable patches (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015).</p>  <p>Ibex are primarily grazers with herbs as well as subshrubs and shrubs such as <em>Eurotia sp</em>., <em>Rosa</em> sp. and <em>Ephedra sp.</em> contributing significantly to their diet (Manjrekar 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Bagchi <em>et al. </em>2004, Tumursukh 2015). </p>  <p>Females gestate for 170-180 days (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961) and usually give birth to one, sometimes two, kids in the spring. The animals reach sexual maturity at 18 months for females and 30 months for males, although usually only older males mate (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Siberian Ibex&#160;can live up to 16-17 years (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961, Fedosenko and Blank 2001).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Throughout its range, local people hunt ibex for subsistence use because they traditionally provide an important supplementary food for local people. Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations.<br/> <br/> In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted <em>Capra sibirica</em>. (Some hair fibers from <em>C. sibirica</em> are quite fine, and potentially may be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, specialty scarves. As of this writing (early 2020), the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from <em>C. sibirica</em>) had not yet been determined, but were still being advertised on the internet as coming from ibex, stating that annually 1500 kg of the wool are produced world-wide (www.acitac.com/materialien/faserkunde/yangir.html). This would require the harvest of a considerable number of animals. Domestic hunting might provide the raw material. Trophy hunting programs harvest only a few animals/year and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially marketed wool product. However, so far interest in ibex wool at local level is unknown and it seems Central Asia is not (yet) a supplier (Michel unpubl. data). If <em>Capra sibirica</em> were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened.<br/> <br/> In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Siberian Ibex&#160;are harvested in trophy hunting programs. Trophy hunting targets only males above a certain age, and so direct impacts on targeted population size likely remain negligible, but poorly regulated trophy hunting can have many negative consequences (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), including an effect on the sex and age composition of populations as reported from Kyrgyzstan (Michel and Rosen 2016). The potential of causing evolutionary effects is low as long as hunter harvest only a minor portion of the males. Bans on trophy hunting and importation of hunting trophies risk removing incentives to prevent poaching and might increase human-caused mortality of ibex.<br/> <br/> Climate change likely poses new threats by altering habitat quality, in particular affecting water availability, vegetation composition and phenology as well as causing changes in land-use. <br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, it seems that prior to the Soviet invasion, Siberian Ibex&#160;was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited, in some areas due to customary regulations (Michel unpubl. data, based information from traditional hunters 2009). Currently hunting is formally banned, but poaching is still a major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency, in particular where military personnel and other armed forces are involved. Poaching became of greater concern in Wakhan National Park (i.e. the district of Wakhan), where border guards and police presence has increased (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2019). <br/> <br/> In China, the species is classified as a Category I Protected Wild Animal Species under the Wild Animal Protection Law (Wang 1998). Poaching might now pose a minor threat, as the government has confiscated most guns from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.<br/> <br/> In India, region-wide threat assessments are scarce. Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2015) report illegal hunting by migratory laborers and migratory herders as one of the most important threats across the state of Himachal Pradesh, followed by subsistence hunting by local people and competition with migratory livestock for fodder. Increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993). Livestock grazing may not necessarily indicate competition, as was evident from summer grazing by local herders in Pin Valley; however, large herds of migratory herders were certainly a threat (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2000, Bagchi <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004). The fact that ibex can utilize rugged habitats have probably allowed them to linger precariously in parts of Himachal Pradesh with heavy grazing by migratory herds of livestock (Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>2015). The level of poaching is extremely low in the Buddhist dominated areas of India (Spiti and Ladakh). Heavy military presence along the disputed border between India and Pakistan can cause considerable disturbance to the species on both sides of the border, including the presence of border fencing. In fact, the ‘highest battlefield in the world’ around the Siachen glacier, contested between India and Pakistan, is surrounded by prime ibex habitat of the Karakorum, but is subjected to considerable military activity.</p>  <p>In Pakistan, poaching for food, heavy military presence on the Indian and Afghanistan borders, and competition for food with livestock are threats to Siberian Ibex. <br/> <br/> In Mongolia, transformation of ibex habitat for mining might be one of the most important emerging threats to the conservation of this species (see Tumursukh <em>et al.</em> 2015). The impact of trophy hunting on ibex populations remains uncertain (Lkhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other important threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali (<em>Ovis ammon</em>) by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively affect the species (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). A recent study by Odonjavkhlan (2018) did not find evidence for an impact of livestock grazing on habitat use by ibex in Tost Tosunbumba Nature Reserve. Tumursukh (2013) found evidence for competition between ibex and goats/sheep for forage; however, he did not find any evidence for demographic impacts from this competition. Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation. Harsh winter weather conditions can also severely affect population sizes locally (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is hunted by local people based on permit systems, but with a large unreported and illegal take. Informal hunting still seems to exceed official quotas in these countries, although the quotas for domestic hunters have not always appeared sustainable. Kyrgyzstan since 2017 has applied temporary hunting moratoria in several provinces, the effect of which is not yet evident.<br/> <br/> In Russia, although hunted legally under license, many are shot illegally and in large numbers.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>No rigorously derived population estimates exist for Siberian Ibex&#160;in any range state, although Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Lkhagvasuren <em>et al. </em>(2016) provide population estimates for most of Mongolia in 2009. Thus, the total population number provided here is a rough guess. Summarizing all available guestimates for the range states the total population size likely would be in the range of 170,000 to 250,000 animals (102,000 to 150,000 mature individuals).<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, the Siberian Ibex&#160;was considered abundant throughout its range prior to the late 1970s and a series of wars. Shank <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1977) estimated that around 5,000 animals used the Ajar Valley Reserve seasonally during the 1970s; this population is likely much smaller now (C. Shank pers. comm. 2007). More than 4,000 were believed to inhabit the Pamir alone. Their present status in the Pamir is unknown, but they are known to persist in reasonably large numbers throughout the ranges of the Wakhan Corridor. There in 2011 WCS recorded 2,069 animals in a direct count (1.6 per km²); in 2015, the double observer method yielded an estimate of 740 ±226 (2.2 per km²) (Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017)<span lang=""EN-US""> and 753 ±267 (2.2 per km²) in 2018 (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2020). The Siberian Ibex&#160;occurs along the Panj River across most of Badakhshan Province, but in some districts is exposed to illegal overhunting and population numbers are unknown (Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> There is no overall population estimate in China. The population in the Tian Shan had been guessed at 40,000-50,000 individuals (Wang 1998). Wu <em>et al. </em>(2015) estimate a density of 1.54 (± 0.23) per km² in the Tien Shan mountains south of Urumqi. Densities in other areas are relatively low. Rough guesses of ibex numbers in the Bei Mountains (northern Gansu) are between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals. The species has almost disappeared in the Daqin Mountains (Gao <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is listed as “Endangered” in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals (Wang 1998).<br/> <br/> In India, earlier population estimates include a minimum of 6,000 in Ladakh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1991a) and perhaps another 4,000 on the south side of the main Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and in the Pir Panjal range of Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1992). A total of up to 15,000 ibex was estimated by Johnsingh, Mishra and Bhatnagar (1997) in <em>ca</em> 40,000 km² of potential habitat based on rough extrapolations. Counts of ibex in protected areas include 330 in the Kanji-Boodkharbu, 225 in Lungnag, 250 in Rangdum, and 174 in Rizong Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir) (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a), and 174 in the Pin Valley National Park (Himachal Pradesh) where Pandey (1993) estimated a density of 2.3 ibex/km² in 1989 and Johnsingh <em>et al.</em> (1997) at a lower value of 1.2 ibex/km². More recently Suryawanshi <em>et al.</em> (2012) estimate a density of 0.37 ibex/km² or 184 (± 40) ibex in 497 km² in Pin Valley National Park; a density of 0.11 ibex/km or 45 (±13) in 411 km² of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary and a density of 0.14 ibex/km² or 30 (±14) in 219 km² of Lossar area of Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Over the past 10 years, these populations have been monitored using similar protocol and the population trends are stable (Suryawanshi, unpublished data). A recent occupancy survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2017) across the state of Himachal Pradesh found that ibex occupy an estimated 8,915 km². They found no evidence of range expansion or contraction in the Himachal Pradesh region between 1992 and 2015. Given these figures, we suspect that total population might not be more than 15,000.<br/> <br/> As reported by Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997), the total number of ibex in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia (as well as in adjacent Russia) was estimated at between 100,000 to 110,000 animals. Most of these occurred in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (<em>ca</em> 70,000) and Kazakhstan (ca. 17,000) with far fewer (8,000 to 9,000) in southern Siberia (3,000 to 3,500 in the Altai, 2,500 in Tannu Ola mountains of Tuva, 1,500 in Western Sayan and 2,000 to 2,500 in Eastern Sayan) and Uzbekistan (2,400). In Kazakhstan, the official numbers reported by the Provincial Territorial Inspection Services for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture (A. Muzbay pers. comm. 2019) during the period 2014-2018 varied between 16,582 and 22,700 (average 20,500). These variations may reflect differences in reporting or methods rather than actual fluctuations of the population size. In Kyrgyzstan, officially reported numbers for the years 2000 – 2013 vary between 34,000 in 2009 and 73,000 in 2000, and are not always fully consistent (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019); the most recent official figure was 41,463 in 2018 (Press Service of the State Agency on Forestry and Environmental Protection, 2019 quoted at https://eco.akipress.org/news:1562027). The abundance varies. There are hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Ala-Arch National Park and Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) with high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low. The population size in the Pamirs and Pamiro-Alay in Tajikistan are unknown, but the species was considered common, especially in the western part of the Pamirs (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers had declined during and after the civil war in Tajikistan in the 1990s and recovered only locally. The total potentially suitable area in Tajikistan is approx. 70,000 km²; if applying the lower density margin (0.2/km²) from the site estimates below the total ibex population size might be 14,000 animals (own guess Michel, 2019). Considering that large areas are intensively used for grazing and poaching impact has reduced population sizes, this figure might be more realistic than higher estimates of up to 25,000 (Kh. Karimov pers. comm. 2019). In Uzbekistan, the population might still be in the range of 2,000-2,500 animals, although the southern part of the Hissar Range in Surkhandarya Province has not been surveyed for the last two decades (E. Bykova pers. comm. 2019). Thus, despite local declines the overall population size seems to be still similar as reported in Shackleton (1997) with no detectable overall trend, but possibly declines at least in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, it is not clear if this apparently stable or slightly declining population size reflects the real situation or continuity in formal reporting by state agencies and hunting organizations. The continuing prevalence of poaching across Central Asia combined with an increase in the intensity and area covered by livestock grazing in mountainous rangelands over the last two decades leads us to suspect an overall more substantial decline in population size than reflected in official numbers. This suspected decline is also supported by site-level estimates in areas with different management regimes </p>  <p>Few site level estimates exist for the Central Asia region. Jumabay-Uulu (2013) estimated a density of 0.67 ibex/km² in 1,341 km² of Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan. Recent surveys (2018) by Khanyari (unpublished data) using the double-observer survey method put the estimates in this area at 2.26 ibex/km². Numbers in community-based conservancies in the Bartang valley, Wakhan and Northern Alichur range of Tajikistan have been stable or increasing between 2009 and 2019 with densities varying between 0.19 and 1.42 animals per km² conservancy area and an absolute number of up to 2,300 over an area of 2,250 km² (unpublished data of ANCOT, 2019). Michel and Muratov (2010) reported direct counts of 2,476 animals in 8,174 km² surveyed area of the eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan (0.30 ibex per km² surveyed area with substantial variation between areas). Point counts in two sections of this area in 2013 yielded estimates of 0.34 animals per km² in an unmanaged area and 0.57 animals per km² in a game management area (unpublished analysis of data of ANCOT by Michel).&#160; <br/> <br/> The Mongolian Red Data Book 1987 (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987), stated that 1,000 individuals inhabited western Khövsgöl alone, and a total of 80,000 animals occurred in Mongolia in the mid-1980s (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) stated that ibex numbers declined since that peak estimate of 80,000 due to exploitation, habitat degradation and competition for resources (Schaller 1994, 1995, 1998). Lkhagvasuren et al. (2016) estimated a total of 36,018 (13,840–43,873) ibex across Mongolia. This is much lower than the 80,000 ibex estimated in mid-1980s. In the Khohk Serkh Reserve in the High Altai, the population was estimated at 1,000 in 1979 by Dzieciolowski <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1980) and at 1,200 by des Clers (1985). Tulgat and Schaller (1992) estimated 600 ibex in the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area. In 1989, in a 200 km² study area west of Tsogt in the Altai, Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1994) counted 337 ibex, and estimated there may have been a total of up to 450 animals. Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) recorded 1,218 ibex in 623 km² of Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Conservation Park (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999b). Tumursukh <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate a density of 0.75 ibex/km² or 1,051 (±196) in 1,400 km² of the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, which were later declared Tost-Tosumbumba Nature Reserve. Few other rigorously derived estimates of population numbers exist for other parts of Mongolia. <br/> <br/> Siberian Ibex&#160;is widely distributed over northern Pakistan, but is only locally abundant in the northern part of the country. Hess (1986) found the highest density in northern Pakistan to be in the area along the Barpu Glacier (Gilgit District) with 1.2 to 1.6 animals/km² (n = 194-270 animals, area surveyed = 164 km<sup>2</sup>). Wegge (1988) estimated that &gt;2,000 ibex lived in the Khunjerab NP, at a slightly lower density of <em>ca</em> 1.0 ibex/km². In many areas the species had densities of only 0.1 to 0.3/km² as in the Shinghai Valley, Gilgit District (n = 15-50 animals, area surveyed = 176 km², Hess, 1986). Within the Gilgit District, Siberian ibex was clearly rarer in the southern than in the northern part. The reasons for this may be that compared to northern areas, elevations in the south are generally lower, there are higher densities of humans using alpine pastures, and there are smaller distances between villages. The census of the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1992) gives 2,545 animals for the whole province; in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 375 were estimated (Qayyum, 1986, 87). Recent surveys by Khan <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a total of 899 ibex in a survey area of 1,895 km² of Khunjerab National Park. They encountered the highest densities of ibex in the Muztagh-Taxkorgan region with an estimated 1.17 ibex per km²<sub>. </sub>Din <sub>et al</sub>. (2011) counted 429 ibex in 1,022 km² of northern Chitral (Torkhow valley). Rahman and Din (2016) in Chipursan Valley (Hunza) recorded 2,085 ibex (0.26/km²). Ali <em>et al</em>. (2007) counted 122 ibex in the Neelum Valley of Azad Kashmir. During 2010-2011 in Nagar Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan Ali <em>et al</em>. (2015) counted 478 in winter and 456 in spring, leading to density estimates of 0.33 and 0.32 per km² respectively. Khan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported 2,777 ibexes from the whole of Gilgit Baltistan, while annual surveys of ibex in central Karakoram National Park suggest numbers to be around 2,500 ibex.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species inhabits the mountain ranges, isolated mountains, and rocky outcrops of central and northeastern Afghanistan, China (northwestern tip of Gansu, western Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, possibly Tibet on its border with Xinjiang, Schaller 1998), northwestern India (Himalaya of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh), southern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia (Altai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, and Sayan Mountains, as well as in the southeast), northern Pakistan, Russia (southern Siberia, southern Tuva, and the Altai Mountains), Tajikistan and northeastern Uzbekistan (west Tian Shan) (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005, Harris <em>et al. </em>2009). </p>  <p>In Afghanistan, Siberian Ibex were historically found in steep habitat throughout the Afghan Hindu Kush and its outlying ranges (e.g., Spinghar, Kohe Baba, Safed Koh, Feroz Koh, Nuristan), but current distribution is not known. Its occurrence has been confirmed since 2000 in suitable habitat throughout the Afghan Pamir and along the Panj River of north-eastern Badakhshan, in particular in Wakhan, Ishkashem, Zebak, Rushan and Darvaz districts (Simms et al. 2014, Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017, Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> In China, Siberian Ibex occur primarily in the mountains surrounding Xinjiang, but also in those of extreme northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Populations are relatively widespread in western Xinjiang (Abudoukadi’er 2003) in the mountains around the Dzungarian Basin, including the mountains along the border with Kazakhstan from south of the Irtysh River, through the Kok Shaal Tau Mountains along the border with Kyrgyzstan and into the Pamir along the border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also throughout the Tian Shan ranges. Populations occur along the Sino-Mongolia border in the Baytik Mountains (Xinjiang), in the Mazongshan area of northern Gansu, and as far east as the Daqinshan of central Inner Mongolia (Wang 1998). Slightly separated from these are populations in the Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang, along China’s borders with Mongolia, and Russia. <br/> <br/> The Siberian Ibex has a widespread distribution in northeastern and eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and southern Siberia, where it occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from hot deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. It is found throughout the ranges of the Pamiro-Alay, Pamir, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Altai, and Tuva Mountains, as well as the western and eastern Sayan (Weinberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Fedosenko 2001). The species occurs in mountainous areas with sufficient rugged escape terrain and suitable pockets of grazing habitat, but is missing in the wide mountain valleys and plateaus intensively used for livestock grazing.<br/> <br/> In Mongolia, Siberian Ibex are patchily distributed in rugged terrain throughout the western half of the country, and in central and south-central Mongolia to the trans-Siberian railway line (Ulaanbaatar to Sainshand) (Dulamtseren 1970, 1977; Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). More specifically, ibex inhabit the Altai, Hangai, and Gobi Altai Mountain Ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Mallon 1985, Schaller 1994, Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). They also occur in the Sayan Mountains near the Russian border west of Lake Hovsgol and in scattered populations in the small mountains in the Transaltai Gobi and in canyons, rocky outcrops, and other rugged terrain throughout the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1977; Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1999a, 1999b; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). A small, introduced population survives in the Bogd Uul Mountains just outside of Ulaanbaatar (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The largest number of ibex occurs in the Altai and western Hangai Mountains (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Populations continue to become increasingly fragmented, especially in central and southeastern Mongolia (Schaller 1994, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). A long-term research project on ibex ecology is being conducted in northern Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in northern Dornogobi Aimag (Reading <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006b, 2007; Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Peterson 2016; Bragin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; Otgonbayar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/> <br/> In India, the Siberian Ibex occurs in the Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir, in the Karakorum, Zanskar and Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and in the Trans Himalayan and Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh, as far east as the Sutlej river (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992; Gaston <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1981; Pandey 1993). The species occurs in the western half of Ladakh, in the Shyok Valley (Nubra region) of northern Ladakh, along the Ladakh Range, and along both sides of the main Himalayan Range eastward to Shingo La (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a, 1992; Mallon 1991; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Its occurrence is very sparse east of the Zanskar River, a tributary of the Indus. It is present along the southern side of the Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir from the Zoji La eastwards to Himachal Pradesh, where it occurs throughout much of Lahul and Spiti, in the upper Beas and Parbati catchments, and Kinnaur in the east, primarily on the right bank of the Sutlej river (Fox <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1992; Pandey 1993; Bhatnagar 2003; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015; Ghoshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In&#160; Pakistan,&#160; the population of Himalayan Ibex&#160;is currently concentrated within the Karakoram Range, especially in the Districts of Hunza (Gojal Valley), Nagar (Hopper and Hisper), Shigar (Basha and Braldu) and Ghanche (Hushey and Kandey) (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015; Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In the Hindu Kush Range, the largest and most stable population occurs in Qurumber National Park and its buffer areas (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In the Himalayas, ibex habitat is shrinking overall; currently it is confined to Shouter Valley of Neelum Valley within the range that was reported for ibex in Pakistani Kashmir (Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Among the valleys of Gilgit-Balitstan that fall in the Himalayas, ibex exist in the Rupal, Rattu and Darley Valleys of Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan. In the Hindu Kush Range, the ibex survives in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the upper Chitral District. It is restricted to the relatively dry mountains between about 3,200 to greater than 5,000 m.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Siberian Ibex are harvested by subsistence hunters for their meat and by trophy hunters primarily for their skulls with horns sometimes also the entire skin. Locally the fur is used to produce high-end wool, called “yangir”, but the extent of this use is not known.",Terrestrial,"<p>Within Afghanistan, ibex are nominally protected from human harvest by a nationwide presidential ban on hunting. Ibex populations residing in the Ajar valley (in Bamyan Province) were listed by the Government’s National Environmental Protection Agency as legally protected in 2009, formally banning all hunting and trading of animals from this population within Afghanistan. They are present in the Wakhan National Park (declared in 2014), and the Bamyan Plateau protected area (declared in 2019), which incorporates the Ajar Valley. They are probably very few left in Band-e-Amir National Park (declared in 2009) and their status in Shah Foladi protected area (declared in 2019) is unknown. Conservation measures proposed include surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species.<br/> <br/> In China, the taxon is listed as Class I in the Wildlife Protection Law. Siberian ibex occur in at least eight nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Khanasi and Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), Tuomur Feng, Bogda Feng, Tianchi, West Tian Shan, and Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). Conservation measures proposed include determining the status of populations throughout their distribution in China, providing additional protection in some areas (e.g., in the Altai), considering others for development of managed, sustainable trophy hunting programs. These latter programs may be useful where ibex numbers are sufficiently abundant, and where removal or reduction of livestock is advised, local people should be provided with compensation. In northern Gansu, livestock should be managed to reduce conflicts with <em>C. sibirica</em>. It has also been suggested that a cross-boundary reserve be developed that would connect to the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia, not only to protect ibex but also other species.<br/> <br/> In India, the Project Snow Leopard, a national level policy for conservation in high elevation area promotes landscape scale participatory approaches within multi-use landscape (PSL 2008). Such a policy facilitates working with local communities to reduce impacts of livestock grazing and illegal hunting on wildlife in the region through the implementation of carefully developed management plans. Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2015) corroborate this by finding that most of the wildlife (including ibex) occur outside protected areas in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Siberian ibex is found in several protected areas in the western Himalayan region (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991a, 1994; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Bhatnagar 2003) including: Jammu and Kashmir (undivided) – Kishtwar and Hemis National Parks and Batkal Thajwas, Overa Aru, Kanji, Boodkharbu, Tongri, Rangdum, Karakoram, Lung Nag, Rizong Sabu, and Chukor Wildlife Sanctuaries; Himachal Pradesh - Pin Valley and Great Himalayan (possibly) National Parks and the Daranghati (possibly), Gamgul Siya-Behi, Kanawar, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Manali, Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/> <br/> Within ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia ibex are present in several strictly protected areas (<em>zapovedniks</em>) and National Parks. Among these are important areas: Kazakhstan: Aksu-Dzhabagly, Alma-Ata and Markakol, Altyn-Emel National Park; Kyrgyzstan: Besh-Aral, Naryn, Sarychat-Ertash and Sary-Chelek, Ala-Archa National Park, Khan-Tengri National Park; Russia: Sayano-Shushensky and Altai; Tajikistan: Romit, Zorkul, Tajik National Park; Uzbekistan: Chatkal, Gissar and Zaamin, Ugam-Chatkal National Park, Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserve. Hunting by domestic hunters based on permits and hunting seasons exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and in few hunting areas in Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting for ibex exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting can be important for conserving the species, as it can provide incentives to prevent poaching, but usually only if implemented as community-based programs. Most such operations in the former Soviet Union involve former poachers and the income they provide encourages these people to refrain from poaching and to prevent others from poaching (Michel and Rosen 2016). Bans of trophy hunting as proposed in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and 2019 or prohibition of trophy imports would remove such incentives and could result in higher mortality from unregulated illegal use. In Kyrgyzstan (since 2010) and Tajikistan (since 2008) community-based game management led to local recoveries of ibex numbers (Michel and Rosen 2016) in areas where previously poaching had reduced population sizes to low levels (SULi 2019). For instance, in Tajikistan 4 such game management areas with a total area 2,250 km² harbor about 2,300 animals with further community-based areas under development. Hunting and tourism revenues finance the management of these areas, managed by local NGOs created mainly by former poachers. Also in Kyrgyzstan, on several thousand square kilometers community-based organizations prevent poaching and thus support ibex conservation, although so far hunting quotas have not been assigned in any of these areas. Conservation measures proposed include the expansion of community-based hunting management and protection and the increase of protected areas effectiveness with a focus on stopping poaching and regulation of livestock grazing to prevent forage competition and habitat degradation. </p>  <p>In Mongolia, ibex is legally protected as a Rare species under the Mongolian Law on Fauna and the Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). No general hunting is allowed, but a limited amount of licensed trophy hunting is permitted. The species is listed as Near Threatened in most recent Mongolian Red List (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006), which represents a change in status from the last 2 Mongolian Red Books, in which the species was listed as Threatened (Shagdarsuren 1987; Shiirevdamba <em>et al</em>. 1997). Approximately 14% of the species’ range is protected (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006) and it occurs in at least the following protected areas: Altai-Taivan Bogd, Bodgkhan Mountains, Eej Khairkhan Mountain, Great Gobi, Gobi Gurvan Saikhan, Ikh Nart, Khangai Nuruu, Khar-Uvs Lake, Khokh Serkh Mountain, Khovsgol Lake, Otgontenger Mountain, Sharga Natural Reserve, Silkhem Mountain, Tarvagatai Mountain, Tost Mountains, Tsambagarav, Uvs Lake, and Yoliin Valley. Khokh Serkh Nature Reserve in the Altai region was established specifically for the conservation of this species. A long-term research project on ibex in Ikh Nart has been established for several years now, and several hundred are estimated to be living within this protected area (R. Reading pers. comm.). Conservation measures proposed include: 1) Undertake more rigorous population surveys of all populations; 2) Study the ecology, particularly habitat requirements and movement patterns, and the impacts of livestock grazing on ibex; 3) Hire, train, and equip law enforcement agents, especially for protected areas; 4) Begin using the money generated from trophy hunting to pay for conservation and management of the species, ideally using community-based approaches (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016); 5) Establish new protected areas to conserve additional populations of ibex; and 6) Collaborate better with Russia and China to protect populations that live in border regions. Trophy hunters purchase hunting licenses from which US$800 for Altai ibex and UD$720 for Gobi ibex are theoretically allocated to the government for a quota of 260 animals per year (MNE 2005). Little to none of this money is used specifically for conservation or management of the species (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), although a small percentage of the money goes toward general conservation activities, such as the budgets of regional protected areas administrations. <br/> <br/> Within Pakistan, Shackleton (1997) reported numerous protected areas providing differing levels of protection to ibex. These include: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Agram-Basti Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Goleen Gol Game Reserve (GR); Swat District: Giddar Baik WS, Mahu Dand GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan - Gilgit District: Khunjerab NP, Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Kilik-Mintaka GR, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR, Pakura Nallah GR, Chassi-Bowshdar GR, Nazbar Nallah GR (Rasool no date); Diamir District: Astor WS (Rasool n. d.); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Satpara WS, Nar Nallah GR, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir – Muzaffarabad District: Ghamot GR, Machiara GR (Qayyum 1986, 1987; Zool. Survey Dept. 1986). Mahu Dand GR was created for ibex in 1992. WWF-Pakistan began a hunting program in 1990 at the Bar village near Gilgit (Johnson 1997, Arshad 2002). In 1991, IUCN-Pakistan, with support from UNDP, in co-operation with local people and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, initiated a planning process to survey protected areas and to prepare an overall sustainable-use wildlife management plan for ibex populations. The program involves hunting by both local and foreign hunters. Conservation measures include: 1) Provide complete legal protection for the species and 2) Establish a proper hunting system involving a management plan for locals, as well as for foreigners. Hunting occurs in areas with healthy populations. This trophy hunting program has benefited the ibex population in Pakistan, and helped many populations to recover in several valleys of northern Pakistan (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Palearctic,,False,False,Global
2048,22152905,9919,Hemitragus jemlahicus,Near Threatened,A2bcde,2020,2020-01-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Himalayan Tahr is listed as Near Threatened in view of the general prevalence of ‘old’ and ‘new’ threats, often increasing in intensity. There are small pockets with reasonable densities of tahr but vast areas devoid of them. Overall, tahr populations are on the decline, as indicated by sharp drops and disappearance in some areas, and declining habitat quality, ongoing poaching and impact of livestock as competitor, in other areas. It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years) and the species nearly meets the criteria A2bcde for Vulnerable, but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.","<p>Since Burrard’s (1925) hunting account, Himalayan Tahr has been known to traverse the steepest precipices. In general, they inhabit steep rocky mountain slopes, between 3,000–4,000 m asl, with woods and rhododendron <em>Rhodondendron</em> sp. scrub (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/></p>  <p>In Nepal, various surveys—like those in Kang Chu area (Schaller 1973), Everest National Park (Ale 2007), Langtang National Park (Green, 1979) and Annapurna Conservation Area (Gurung 1995)—reported that tahr occupy various habitat types from open alpine grassland and subalpine scrubland to sparse or even dense forests (tahr winter habitat). Precipitous cliffs break the continuity of these habitats. The best tahr habitat in the Everest region can be described as cliff faces broken by ledges supporting grasses, forbs and shrub mats at higher altitudes (mean 3,863 m, SE=0.9, range 3,260 m - 4,800 m, n=191) and patches of open pine or birch forest at lower altitude (mean 3,621 m, SE=1.4, range 3,300 m - 4,031 m, n=66). Tahr was reported from as high as 5,200 m (e.g., in Langtang: Fox 1974) and as low as 2,500 m in Kang Chu (Schaller 1977). In these mountains, steep hill slopes and undulating terrains are often characteristically interrupted by abrupt cliffs which act as oasis for these cliff-huggers whose presence is often predictive in these enclaves. This cliff-hugging behaviour of tahr restricts its own distribution (Ale 2007) and perhaps limits its group size as well. </p>  <p>Himalayan Tahr is diurnal, with varying group sizes depending on the degree of habitat ruggedness that characterizes particular localities. Group size of tahr is also influenced by the abundance of food and predation pressure. For instance, in Everest, group size ranged from 1-46 (average of ca. 8, n=277), during 2004 to 2006 (Lovari 1992, Ale 2007). The average group size increased over the decade in Everest perhaps in response to the return of snow leopards to the region (Ale 2007). Tahr formed comparatively larger groups in Annapurna Base Camp, Annapurna Conservation Area (13.8, range 1-57, n=134: Gurung 1995) and Langtang (average 15, largest group 77: Green 1979). Both Annapurna and Langtang lacked large predator, such as the snow leopard, in alpine and subalpine habitat, but most of these areas were characterized by undulating grasslands and scrublands thereby providing more plant forages for herbivores. <br/></p>  <p>The prevalence of local hunting may also influence the average group size. In Himachal Pradesh, western Himalaya (India), group size was very small (ca. 1.7, n = 7) with severe hunting in the past (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1983). This may have been reflected in the overall density reported from different study sites. In Everest, the tahr density was ca. 3.4/km<sup>2</sup> (with no human hunting but presence of large predator). Gurung (1995) reported tahr at the density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup> from Annapurna, with no human hunting and no large predator. In the absence of local hunting or natural predation, food can be the principle factor liming the size of populations. In overall Langtang (with no large predator and no human hunting), Tiwari (2006) reported 8.72 tahr/km<sup>2</sup> (8 herds, 218 individuals, in an area of 25 square kilometre). In the Langtang region of Langtang National Park, local density of tahr reached as high as 24/km<sup>2</sup> (Green 1979: 170 in 7 km<sup>2</sup>), where tahr was neither hunted nor its habitat grazed by livestock. On the other hand, Yala region of Langtang National Park, with ten times more domestic sheep and eight times more cattle than Langtang region, reached low tahr density (6/km<sup>2</sup>). In the absence of hunting in parts of New Zealand, tahr attained densities of &gt;30/km<sup>2 </sup>(Tustin and Challies, 1978). Female groups can reach very high densities in New Zealand, with groups of 100–150 commonly observed in areas that have not been hunted (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data). With regular hunting their population, however, maintained a density of ca. 5/km<sup>2</sup> (Tustin and Challies 1978)</p>  <p>Mating occurs from October to January, with it peaking around the first half of December (Lovari, S., unpubl. data). One or occasionally two kids are born in June and July after a gestation of 180-242 days. The age at sexual maturity is 1.5 years, with captive animals living up to 22 years (Smith <em>et al</em>., 2008). Females have home ranges of about 2 km<sup>2</sup> centred on rock bluffs. Males appear to be highly mobile, and outside of the rut are segregated from females (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data).</p>    <p>Himalayan Tahr is known to eat grass, herbs and some fruits. On Mt. Everest, tahr’s diets consisted typically of such grasses and sedges as <em>Carex, Avena</em>, <em>Poa</em>, <em>Trisetum</em>, <em>Cyperaceae</em> and <em>Imperata</em>. (Shrestha et al. 2002): overall, the diets were composed of 47% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 28% grasses and 25% sedges. This was similar to that Green (1979) reported for tahr in Langtang valley (38% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 34% grasses, 21% sedges, 4% ferns and 4% mosses). Green (1979) found in winter tahr supplemented its diet with small amounts of mosses and ferns, presumably because other food is less readily available. The diets of livestock and tahr were similar in the Everest region, but the proportion of woody plants (<em>Rhododendron</em> and <em>Cotoneaster</em>) was higher and that of grasses and sedges were lower in the diet of livestock than tahr. </p>","<p>The major threats in China are uncontrolled hunting and deforestation. In India, Himalayan Tahr is hunted for meat, and there is apparently significant competition with livestock for summer grazing in some areas. <span lang=""EN-IN"">Tahr possibly survive in small patches of steep, rugged forests around the sub-alpine zone, while much of its habitat is lost due to heavy pressure from local people and from developmental pressures. In Nepal, threats come from an expanding human population and accompanying increases in livestock, habitat loss, and poaching. As a result of these factors, tahr populations are becoming increasingly isolated. Besides threats related to anthropogenic activities, avalanches during winters with high snowfall also can be a significant mortality factor for tahr.</p>","<p>No global population estimate of Himalayan Tahr is currently available. The rate of its population change is unknown.<br/><br/>Only a few Himalayan Tahr have been observed in China (Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986). Perhaps, between 400 and 500 tahr, all located in southern Tibet, may exist in China (Wang 1998).<br/><br/>No estimate of tahr population in India is available, however, a number of sporadic counts of tahr are available from across the range. In Himachal Pradesh, for instance, approximately 130 in Kanawar Wildlife Sanctuary, and over 100 in Great Himalayan National Park (S. Pandey, pers. comm.) were reported. Population estimates have also been reported from parts of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary: 70 in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1994), and 110 in the Tungnath region of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Kittur <em>et al</em>. 2006). One survey between 1996 and 1998 indicated 50 tahr inhabiting Tirthan valley of the Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). Kandpal and Sathyakumar (2010) reported tahr from the Pindari glacier area. A recent high altitude ungulate survey in 2016 estimated 297 tahr (range: 222–565, 0.32 animals/sq. km) from Uttarakhand (Habib <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest several local extinctions of tahr in India (Sathyakumar, S., unpubl. data). They may be close to extirpation from western parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The entire population reported earlier from north of the Chenab River (between Kisthwar and the Banihal pass) is believed to be locally extinct now. Small populations of tahr survive in Bani-Sarthal (Kathua) and Kisthwar National Park (Kisthwar-Doda) (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Density estimates ranging from as high as 19.6 to 25.7<span lang=""EN-IN""> per km² (Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttarakhand) (Sathyakumar 1994) and from as low as 1.4 to 4.6 <span lang=""EN-IN"">per km² (Great Himalayan National Park, Himachal Pradesh) (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999) have been reported from different parts of Western Himalaya.<br/><br/></span>A different abundance index, that is, encounter rates (number/km walked) indicated tahr was less abundant in Nanda Devi National Park than Tungnath in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1993, 1994). Also, the tahr population was denser in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary than Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). A camera trap survey (trap nights/100 days) from the upper catchment of Bhagirathi River revealed higher abundance of tahr in temperate habitat (4.4 ± 2.62) than alpine habitat (0.6 ± 0.34) (Pal <em>et al</em>., in press). In Sikkim, an intensive study in Prek Chu Catchment found the presence of Himalayan Tahr in subalpine and alpine zone, but they were rare compared to other ungulates such as blue sheep (Bhattacharya 2013).<br/><br/>No total population size estimates of tahr are available for Nepal, but there have been several sporadic surveys from different parts of the country over the decades. Bauer (1988) estimated 1,000 tahr for Sagamartha, Makalu-Barun and Langtang National Parks. These three regions obviously support more tahr than Bauer’s estimates, as revealed by relatively recent studies (see below).<br/><br/>Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park can easily support 700-800 tahr, at least half of them occurring in Namche, Phorste, Thame and Gokyo valleys, in an area of <em>ca</em> 160 km². The overall mean group size was 8.5, from 2004 to 2006, with an overall density of 3.4/km2 (Lovari et al. 2009, Ale 2007). Between 1989 and 2010, there was a decrease of tahr by some 2/3, from ca 350 to <em>ca</em> 100 tahr, in the core area of Sagarmatha National Park because of increased predation following the return of the snow leopard (Lovari &amp; Mishra 2016). The recent data are lacking but numbers of predator and prey may have estabilised by now in Everest (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The most recent survey, in 2012, revealed a minimum of 394 tahr from Langtang in ca. 79.3 km² (density 5.3 tahr/km²: Thapa 2012). Green’s (1978) density estimates in Langtang National Park were similar in some localities (6.8 per sq. km) but in other localities they reached as high as s 25.0 per square kilometre.<br/><br/>Tahr has been reported from all of Nepal’s mountain protected areas but there have been no systematic surveys in these parks. No data on tahr are available from Gaurishankar Conservation Area, but in 2010 a short survey on the status of snow leopards also revealed the presence of tahr in Rolwaling valley in Gaurishankar. Their numbers, however, were dwindling (just 12 individuals observed, although with a decent kid-to-female ratio of 0.7: Ale <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent survey (Devkota <em>et al</em>. 2017) in an area of 124.2 km<sup>2</sup> in the upper reaches of Tsum valley, in Manaslu Conservation Area, revealed 223 tahr (nine herds, average group size of 25, range 2 to 74 individuals; a density of 1.8 animals per km<sup>2</sup>). Earlier in 2012, just two-day observations yielded at least 400 in the Tsum Valley and a similar number from the Budhi Gandhaki Valley in Manaslu (Sandro Lovari and Madhu Chettri, unpubl. data). The recent status of tahr in Annapurna Conservation Area is lacking but Gurung (1995) counted over 500 tahr in Annapurna Base Camp (density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>A total of 285 tahr were reported from Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve by Kandel <em>et al</em>. (2011). Tahr has been sighted in Shey Phoksundo, Khaptad, and Rara National Parks, in western Nepal. Even though there have been no formal surveys, each of these parks were reported to support at least 50 tahr, according to local experts (quoted in Gurung, 1995). Many districts that fall outside of protected areas, such as Dolpo, Jumla, Humla and Jajarkot, have been reported to contain sparse populations of tahr (Raju Acharya, Karan B. Shah, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest that considerable local extinctions of tahr have taken place in Nepal. Overall, conservative estimates of tahr population for entire Nepal may not exceed 10,000 (Som B. Ale, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The potential habitat of Himalayan Tahr, worldwide, between 2,200 m and 4,200 m elevation, is estimated at <em>c.</em> 44,200 km<sup>2</sup> with most areas being in Nepal (that is, 22,455 km<sup>2</sup>), followed by India (20,248 km<sup>2</sup>) and China (1,465 km<sup>2</sup>). Suitable tahr habitat occurs in Himachal Pradesh (8,903 km<sup>2</sup>), Uttarakhand (6,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and Sikkim (865 km<sup>2</sup>), and Jammu and Kashmir (3,979 km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>The current global population of Himalayan Tahr in its native range (that is, China, India and Nepal) is difficult to estimate due to the paucity of data, but it may not exceed the size of introduced populations in New Zealand, South Africa, United States of America, and Argentina (likely extinct). No attempts to census tahr populations have been made from the other countries except from New Zealand. The total abundance of tahr in New Zealand alone, from 2016 to 2018, was placed between 24,777 and 47,461, with average density ranging from 0.06 to 9.2 tahr/km<sup>2</sup>.</p>",Decreasing,"Himalayan Tahr is found in the Himalaya of China, India and Nepal spread over an estimated 44,200 km², however the actual area of occurrence may be much smaller given extirpation and currently unsuitable habitats in between. Outside the Himalayas, tahr was introduced to the South Island of New Zealand and Western Cape Province in South Africa (Grubb 2005). They were accidentally released in Cibola National Forest Mountain (New Mexico, USA) from a game ranch, and in Neuquén province and Parque Diana ranch of Argentina perhaps illegally by ranchers (Flueck 2010), and possibly now extinct from Neuquén (Guichon <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In China, Himalayan Tahr was discovered in 1974 in Quxiang of Buoqu Valley (aka Zhangmu Valley) in southern Tibet (Beijing Natural History Museum and Qinghai Institute of Biology 1977). Since then, there has been no additional information pertaining to its occurrence or status. A confirmed report of species presence came from Tibet’s Geelong-Buoqu Valleys (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986, Wang 1998, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Qomolangma Nature Reserve (pers. comm., Labaciren) where numbers of tahr have been sighted regularly in the Rongxia and Chentang valleys.<br/><br/>In India, Himalayan Tahr occurs along subalpine regions across southern forested slopes in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim (Sathyakmuar 2002). Populations are patchily distributed from south-central Kashmir through the southern part of Kullu (Himachal Pradesh) between c. 2,000 and 3,300 m (Gaston et al. 1981, 1983). They are widely present at similar elevations from northern Uttarakhand all the way to the border of Nepal. Small numbers of tahr also inhabit east Sikkim (nearby India-Nepal border) and west Sikkim (close to India-Bhutan border).<br/><br/>In Nepal, Himalayan Tahr formerly had a continuous distribution between 1,500 m and 5,200 m, but this has been increasingly disrupted by human activities such as livestock-grazing and subsistence hunting (Green 1978, 1979, Ale, S. B. unpubl. data). Overall, in Nepal, tahr inhabits temperate to sub-alpine forests and alpine meadows, mainly between <em>ca</em> 2,500 m and 4,000 m, but individuals at times venture up to 5,200 m. Schaller (1977) mapped fourteen locations of tahr in Nepal, but there are undoubtedly more.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, tahr is reported from the Jigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve (Tshewang <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Bhutan Government’s Nature Conservation Division of the Department of Forest and Park Services has not confirmed its presence in the country (Sonam Wangdi, December 2019, pers. comm.).","<p>In New Zealand, there is occasional commercial harvesting of tahr for meat. There is a substantial recreational hunt of this species, and adult males (≥4.5 years old) are highly sought after as trophies by recreational and trophy hunters.</p>  In Nepal’s only in one hunting reserve, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Himalayan Tahr is harvested for trophy (blue sheep, <em>Pseudois nayaur</em>, were more sought after than Himalayan Tahr). The income thus generated has been used for conservation and local income generation activities (Karki and Thapa 2011). Two types of revenue have been generated through trophy hunting: the revenue collected by the Nepal’s government’s wildlife department, and money collected by local communities (although not substantiated on a legal basis, so monetary figures are not known: the charge to hunters may have varied from $533–1,333 for a Himalayan Tahr (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015). Locals used the money collected from tahr and blue sheep trophy-hunting for community development activities, for example, upgrading facilities of the local health post, constructing trails, and maintaining a bridge. Government revenue collected from 2007 to 2012 totalled $184,372, a portion of which went to conservation activities (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Terrestrial,"<p>Himalayan Tahr is not listed under threatened category of CITES. </p>  <p>It is listed as Category I species in China. Conservation measures proposed for China included undertaking surveys to determine the species’ distribution and status in Qomolangma Nature Reserve&#160;(Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Qomolangma&#160;Nature Reserve started the snow leopard program in 2015 funded by Vanke Foundation. The program undertook a large-scale wildlife survey and subsequent conservation projects that included educating local communities about tahr and other wildlife. </p>  <p>In India, protected areas with Himalayan Tahr include: Jammu and Kashmir – Kishtwar National Park (locally threatened); Himachal Pradesh - Great Himalayan National Park (confirmed), and Daranghati (locally threatened), Gamgul Siahbehi, Kanawar, Khokhan, Kugti, Manali (locally threatened or extinct), Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah (locally threatened) Wildlife Sanctuaries; Uttarakhand -Nanda Devi and (probably) Valley of Flowers National Parks, Govind Pashu Vihar and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuaries; and Sikkim - Khangchendzonga National Park (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981, 1983, Green 1987; Kathayat and Mathur 2002). Tahr uses rugged forested slopes with temperate oak and pine forests, well below the subalpine areas where it is often currently located. This suggests that its current range distribution may reflect displacement from formerly used lower elevation areas. Conservation measures proposed for India include: 1) extend the Great Himalayan National Park as proposed, 2) establish the proposed Srikhand National Park (Himachal Pradesh), 3) devise innovative community based reserves for the species outside protected areas (these need to include community based protection, tourism, awareness, etc.), and 4) include areas with tahr in the innovative, participatory, landscape level planning and action under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Project Snow Leopard. Overall, the country’s conservation strategy clearly states conserving species in and outside protected areas.</p>  <p>A significant proportion of Nepal’s tahr occurs within protected areas, but its population is widespread in areas outside of protected areas (e.g., the region that lies between Manaslu and Langtang, Bhimthang valley between Manalsu and Annapurna, and Dolpo, Jumla, Mugu and Humla districts). The species occurs in all mountain protected areas of Nepal: Langtang, Rara, Sagamartha (Everest), Makalu-Barun and Shey-Phoksundo National Parks; Api Nampa, Annapurna, Manalsu, Gaurishankar and Kanchanjunga Conservation Areas, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, and Khaptad National Park. </p>  <p>Conservation measures proposed for Nepal: 1) maintain the current, closely controlled, legal hunting program in Dhorpatan, 2) consider a regulated program of low-level subsistence hunting by local villagers, and 3) undertake surveys to understand the increasing fragmentation of tahr populations and offer mitigation measures. The first steps to address this issue would be to begin in selected areas by mapping tahr habitat features such as cliffs (using 1:50,000 topographic maps), followed by ground surveys to validate the species’ presence/absence.</p>  <p>Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is the only reserve in Nepal that allows trophy hunting of Himalayan Tahr along with blue sheep. From 2008 to 2011, Karki and Thapa (2011) reported 34 Himalayan Tahr were harvested: 18 in 2008/09 (100% harvest; quota set by the government), 11 (61% in 2009/10) and 5 (28 % in 2010/11). A quick glance on the numbers harvested indicates they were not so small numbers if adult males have been the only target. It would mean some 10-15 % of the adult male (trophy) population (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm). Perhaps the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation – Nepal should consider revaluating the trophy hunting of tahr on a sustainable basis.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

The population is declining because this species is being over-harvested for food and because of widespread habitat loss through much of its range. The species is close to qualifying for Vulnerable under criterion A2cd.,"In South Asia, it is a diurnal and arboreal species occasionally feeding on the forest floor. It occurs in tropical and subtropical montane evergreen and dry deciduous forests. It is found to occupy tree hollows in mid high canopy (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005). In Lao PDR, Evans <em>et al.</em> (2000) found this species to be common in evergreen and semi-evergreen broadleaf forest, and rarely present in pine forest. It is found from the plains up to at least 1,400 m (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). It has been suggested that one of the reasons for low densities of this species in Malaysian tropical rain forest is competition from the great variety of other arboreal vertebrates (such as birds, and especially primates) for food, especially fruits and leaves, which are among the food items preferred by squirrels (Saiful and Nordin 2004). This species feeds on pine cones and oak trees on Java (Boeadi pers. comm.). It is not tolerant of habitat modification, and has a long generation time of eight to nine years, with a litter size of one or two young.","Human induced habitat degradation due to shifting (jhum) agriculture practices, small-scale logging, clear-cutting, forest fires, expansion of human settlement, harvesting for local consumption have been observed to be major threats for this species in South Asia (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005). It is threatened by hunting and habitat loss in China (Wang <em>et al.</em> 1989). This species is especially vulnerable to hunting and habitat loss (often through logging operations) in Lao PDR (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000), Viet Nam and Thailand. This species was ""formerly one of the most commonly sold mammals in the That Luang fresh food market in Vientiane"" (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). Hunting pressure is predicted to increase in Cambodia, as following the over-harvesting of large bodied mammals, smaller species are now being targeted (W. Duckworth pers. comm.).

These animals avoid open desert (such as the centre of the Arabian desert and the Sahara, though they may occur at low density in the central Saharan massifs), dense thickets and forests. Nevertheless, it was reported from Lebanon and Jordan that they inhabit thick Mediterranean oak forests (Abi-Said 2006, Qarqaz <em>et al. </em>2004), and also avoid high altitudes; however, it has been recorded to 3,300 m in Pakistan (Roberts 1977), 2,700 m in the Moroccan High Atlas (Cuzin 2003), at least to 2,300 m in the Ethiopian Highlands (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996), and 2,200 m in the Lebanese mountains (Abi-Said and Marrouche Abi-Said 2007). Striped Hyaenas are sometimes found close to dense human settlements (e.g., Israel, Lebanon and Algeria). Individuals have been recorded 19 km south of Tel Aviv, 5 km east of the international airport and on the Tel Aviv-Haifa highway near Mount Carmel (Hofer 1998 and references therein), the highest density in Lebanon was recorded in an urban area 10 km north of Beirut (Abi-Said and Marrouche Abi-Said 2007),&#160;and in the suburbs of Algiers (K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007). Striped Hyaenas are unafraid of humans and frequently forage on garbage and carrion near to human habitation (Alam <em>et al.</em> 2014, Tourani <em>et al. </em>2012,&#160;Abi-Said 2006, K. de Smet, F. Cuzin and M. Masseti pers. comm. 2014). Young animals are even kept as pets in some areas.","The major reasons for the apparent decline include persecution (especially poisoning), decreasing natural and domestic sources of carrion due to declines in the populations of other large carnivores (Wolf, Cheetah, Leopard, Lion, Tiger) and their prey, and changes in livestock practices (Hofer 1998). Humans are consistently indicated as the major source of mortality throughout the evaluated range, largely because the hyaena is loathed as a grave robber,&#160;is associated with several superstitions&#160;(e.g. in the Middle East), and because of incidents of damage to agriculture (e.g. in Israel) and livestock (Abi-Said 2006, Bunaian <em>et al.</em> 2001, Hofer 1998, Al Younis 1993, Wagner 2013). Striped Hyaenas are very susceptible to accidental or targeted poisoning as they readily accept strychnine-poisoned bait. For example, along the Mediterranean coast in Israel, the&#160;Striped Hyaena&#160;was exterminated by strychnine poisoning during the rabies eradication campaign administered by the British government between 1918 and 1948. The&#160;Striped Hyaenas ate poisoned donkey carcasses that were provided to control Golden Jackals, then the main carrier of rabies. Further large-scale poisoning occurred between 1950 and 1970 (Hofer 1998). In Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palmyra area in Syria, the species is heavily persecuted (including destruction or blockage of dens, poisoning carcasses, or the use of the fire to chase animals out of dens) (Abi-Said 2006, Qarqaz <em>et al. </em>2004). There is also illegal trade in skins, and body parts for use in traditional medicine (as there is elsewhere in the range), and they are often kept in cages for display purposes (G. Serra pers. comm. 2014). The species is commercially hunted in Morocco for use in traditional medicine, with various parts being used (especially the brain) and may fetch very high prices. Hunters may travel hundreds of kilometres to capture this species (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007).","Hofer and Mills (1998b) estimated the total population of striped hyaena at 5,000 to 14,000 individuals (see Table 5.2 in Hofer and Mills 1998b). Such an assessment of the current population trends of the Striped Hyaena is complicated by a number of problems (they are nocturnal, solitary, occur at low densities often in rugged country, sightings are infrequent, and surveys difficult to carry out). Moreover, in areas where the range of the&#160;Striped Hyaena&#160;overlaps with that of the Spotted Hyaena and the Aardwolf, few people acknowledge or recognize a difference between the three hyaenid species. Nonetheless, even if the overall population is larger than this estimate, based on their questionnaire survey, Hofer and Mills (1998b) found that the Striped Hyaena is already extinct in many localities and that populations are generally declining throughout its range.<br/><br/>As noted,&#160;Striped Hyaenas&#160;occur at low population densities. A large study in Laikipia District, central Kenya, estimated the minimum regional density at 0.03 adults/km² (Wagner 2006), while van Aarde <em>et al.</em> (1998) estimated more than 0.016/km² in the Negev Desert (see also Table 5.1 in Hofer and Mills 1998b). Close estimates of 0.011/km²&#160;were found in Lebanon (Abi-Said 2006).",Decreasing,"The Striped Hyaena has a very large, albeit now patchy distribution, extending from Africa, north of and including the Sahel, and including much of east and northeast Africa south to about central Tanzania, through the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula, Turkey, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, though not reaching Assam, Bhutan or Myanmar. They may have recently expanded into Nepal (Hofer and Mills 1998a). <br/><br/>Although historically present, there are few reliable recent records of occurrence in Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (Andrews 2008, Cunningham 2004, Hofer and Mills 1998a).

Because they exist outside of formally protected areas in regions where pastoralism is the norm and the potential for human-carnivore conflict is very high (for example, in Egypt and Kenya), particular attention should be paid to identifying ways to reduce human-carnivore conflict through promotion of methods that ensure adequate numbers of prey persist and/or methods that reduce livestock killing by all carnivores (Wagner 2013). Good domestic waste management (Yom-Tov 2003, Qarqaz <em>et al.</em> 2004, Abi-Said and Marrouche Abi-Said 2007, Tourani <em>et al. </em>2012) and a well-designed public awareness program proved to be very successful in changing attitudes to promote conservation in some areas (Abi-Said 2006).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

These declines&#160;over the past three generations&#160;are projected to continue, through the&#160;same factors, for the next three.","Altai Weasel occurs&#160;only outside closed forest habitats, typically in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, dry&#160;steppes and&#160;plains, and river valleys with reeds and bushes&#160;(e.g., Heptner <em>et al</em>. 1967,&#160;Hornskov and Foggin 2007,&#160;Bischof&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). It is also found in sparse forest vegetation and predominantly open landscape (Kruska 1990). It often occurs close to human settlements and agriculture (e.g,.&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). It is exclusively carnivorous, preying mainly upon&#160;pikas <em>Ochotona</em>, various rodents&#160;(voles, mice, hamsters), small birds, lizards, and insects (Pocock 1941). It is particularly dependent upon pikas across much of its range (Smith and Foggin 1999). The gestation period is 38-40 days, without delayed implantation. The litter size is 2-6, sometimes (in captivity)&#160;up to 13 (Sludsky <em>et al</em>. 1982). It is ground-dwelling, but climbing readily on rock-piles and fallen wood (e.g., Hornskov and Foggin 2007,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). Despite&#160;some&#160;statements to the contrary, it is evidently&#160;diurnal across much or all of its range&#160;(e.g., Tibetan plateau, Hornskov and Foggin 2007; northern Pakistan,&#160;Bischof <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014; Nepal,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014).","This species is threatened by ongoing habitat conversion across&#160;most of its range. These effects seem to be worsening with climate change. Most seriously there are agriculturally-driven pika <em>Ochotona</em>-control campaigns across much of this&#160;species's range, which have eradicated the weasel's main food from large areas (Hornskov and Foggin 2007). It is affected by 'mountain meadow' degradation, of the habitats to which it is particularly adapted: on the Tibetan plateau,&#160;Hornskov and Foggin (2007) observed that&#160;""in most places the natural vegetation cover has been partially to seriously overgrazed by domestic bovids (yak and yak/cow hybrids) and sheep: only a few areas remain with little or no human/livestock impact on the grassland vegetation"". This species does not tolerate a high degree of alteration and it avoids agricultural lands. In Nepal it is killed for use as a medicinal charm but given its ongoing common occurrence close to human settlements, this does not seem to be at levels sufficient to threaten it (Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). Widely elsewhere in its&#160;range it is occasionally hunted, perhaps mostly for fur,&#160;but probably not at levels to drive population declines.","The species is common but not abundant throughout its range (e.g., Hornskov and Foggin 2007). Population density fluctuates depending on prey abundance by 4 or 5 times.",Decreasing,"Altai Weasel is found in central and east Asia, with a range comprising China; Pakistan; the Himalaya in&#160;India (Kashmir eastward to Arunachal Pradesh), Nepal and Bhutan; eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia and parts of Russia (southern and south-eastern Siberia, Primorski Krai) (Wang 2003, Wozencraft 2005, Choudhury 2013, Bischof&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). Ladakh, India, is&#160;often omitted from the range but it is found there regularly&#160;(Ben-Yehuda in prep.). The proximity of some records in Pakistan to Afghanistan (Bischof&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014)&#160;suggests that it will also be found to occur in&#160;Afghanistan.&#160;It has been said to inhabit DPR Korea (Wozencraft 2005) but this appears to be&#160;based on a prediction, albeit a plausible one given the proximity of&#160;some records in China to Korea&#160;(Won and&#160;Smith 1999).&#160;<br/><br/>This species's&#160;altitudinal use varies across its range. It&#160;is found in North-east India&#160;mostly from 1,500 to&#160;4,500 m (Choudhury 2013). A recent&#160;series of records from Nepal was at 3,970-4,890&#160;m, despite approximately equal&#160;search effort above and below 4,000 m&#160;(Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). On the Tibetan plateau, Hornskov and Foggin (2007) observed it over 2,300-4,700 m. Further north, it occurs down to the lowlands:&#160;in Kazakhstan it occurs from plain river valleys (340 m) up to 3,000 m in mountains of Dzhungar Alatau (Sludsky <em>et al</em>. 1982), whereas&#160;records from Russian Far East (the plains near Lake&#160;Khanka) are at elevations&#160;of about 80-100 m (A.V. Abramov pers. comm. 2014).","In Nepal, and perhaps elsewhere in its range, mummified bodies are hung in houses as a perceived way of reducing the threat of death to newborn human babies (Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). This use is projected to decline with increasing access to modern medicine. During 1930-1970, it was actively hunted for fur in the eastern part Kazakhstan (mainly in the valley of the River&#160;Ili&#160;and near&#160;Lake&#160;Balkhash). More than 23,000 &#160;were trapped here in 1933 (Sludsky <em>et al</em>. 1982). Recently, there has been&#160;no special fur hunting in Russia or Kazakhstan because of its&#160;low population density and the low fur price (A.V.

Nevertheless, preliminary analysis on available data suggests that the species is negatively impacted by intensive irrigated agriculture that has fragmented its prime habitat and perhaps also its population in India (see Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;The absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, a future prediction on population decline can be made based on available information on the geographical range of the species, niche model analysis and current change in land use regimes.<br/><br/>Most of the distributional range of the species in India and Nepal lies outside the protected area network and in the deciduous forests of central India which are severely disturbed. The total extent of prime habitat in India and Nepal is around 25% of the total distributional range within these countries.<br/><br/>The current (2015) Government of India has made provisions for speedy approval of developmental projects in non-protected areas including areas under mining, industrialisation and urbanisation (Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Moreover, there are plans for expanding the national area under agriculture by 10% by 2017 (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014), a development which will continue in the future. Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species are rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy since the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. The impact of this development on persistence of biodiversity remains unclear.<br/><br/>Assuming 10 years as the average life span of the Rusty-spotted Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year, we estimate the average age of mature individuals (Generation Length - GL) in the current population at around 4 years, using the formula by Pacifici <em>et al.</em> (2013): GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3, Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR). In the next three Rusty-spotted Cat generations, i.e. 12 years, the prime locations where populations are likely to persist are protected areas as these are the only zones remaining close to intact. This translates to 75% of habitat in the current distributional range facing an imminent danger of being converted. As much of this is marginal habitat for the species, a 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over the next three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population and therefore has a concomitantly greater contribution to the overall ‘average’ global change.<br/><br/>Therefore, a future decline of 20-25% over the next three generations is suspected, occurring primarily due to projected habitat loss in central India, with populations stable only in protected areas and little information available about the small proportion of the population found in Sri Lanka.","Though the species is also found in proximity to human habitation (Worah 1991, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mukherjee 1998, Nekaris 2003), preliminary results of a study using niche models and known Rusty-spotted Cat locations within India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material), suggests that at a broad scale this cat’s distribution is limited by large contiguous tracts of hostile habitat, specifically intensive, irrigated agriculture (Silva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These results were a consensus of four models that incorporated land cover, bioclimatic variables and disturbance measures with 61 location points of the species. The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>There are recent records of the Rusty-spotted Cat from the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka in small, mostly isolated forest patches (&lt;5 km²) interspersed with tea estates but it is not known if the species occurs in or uses the tea plantation areas (Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). <br/><br/>A few observations suggest that the species preys on rodents (Kunal Patel and Vidya Athreya <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em>).","Habitat loss and the spread of cultivation are serious problems for wildlife in South Asia. The total extent of prime habitat of the Rusty-spotted Cat in India and Nepal is equivalent to around 25% of the range of the species in these countries. These are perhaps the only areas where populations of the species are likely to persist in the future. This translates to 75% of the current habitat in India and Nepal facing an imminent danger of conversion to urban areas, industry, mining and other forms of land use hostile to Rusty-spotted Cat (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014, Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species is rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy during the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. Categorization of certain portions of the species’s habitat (scrub, degraded forest) as wasteland facilitates such conversion (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.). <br/><br/>As much of the distributional range constitutes marginal habitat for the species, this 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population<br/><br/>Since much of the species’s range is within hugely human-dominated areas undergoing rapid land use change, fragmentation of habitat and disease should be considered as serious threats. There are concerns regarding possible hybridization of Rusty-spotted Cat with domestic cats (Kittle and Watson 2004) but these have yet to be substantiated and measured to determine if this factor is indeed a threat to the species. There is a belief that Rusty-spotted Cats do not get into conflict, unlike Jungle Cats, since they are believed not to prey on poultry (Manakadan and Sivakumar 2006). However, this needs to be backed by research and the threats need to be evaluated across the species’s global distribution. <br/><br/>Reflecting the uncertainty of this assessment, the species should be prioritised for research and monitoring.","Information on this species is not just meagre but also incidental and hence it is difficult to infer, with confidence, its population size, connectivity between populations, threats, and persistence in the future. It appears to be rare almost wherever it occurs (Kunal Patel and Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). <br/><br/>Population trend: the absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, the niche model from India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material) suggests a fragmented population.&#160;The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country (Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"The Rusty-spotted Cat was earlier believed to be restricted to India and Sri Lanka but recent photographic records show its presence in Bardia National Park, Nepal (Ramjan Choudhary and Rabin Kadariya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), bordering India. Its geographical distribution is as yet not clearly documented but recent locality records suggest it is more widespread than earlier believed (Chakraborty 1978, Phillips 1984, Wright 1984, Miththapala 2006, Athreya 2010, Mukherjee <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Raza Kazmi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Jugal Tiwari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Anonymous 2013, Dharmendra Khandal <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Pankaj Koparde and Gaurang Gowande <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,&#160;Ramjan Choudhary and&#160;Rabin Kadariya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Andrew Kittle <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Nevertheless it has a relatively restricted global distribution for a cat and little is known of its ecology or local abundance (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).

In Taiwan, the species has undergone continuous declines of &gt;90% in several of the largest known colonies and estimated losses of &gt;70% of known individuals in the last 30 years and similar patterns are suspected throughout its range.","Habitat use, roost ecology and natural history for the species at global  scale are poorly known. In Taiwan, the species has been known to roost  in foliage of 35 plant species, mainly broad-leaved trees (e.g.  <em>Terminalia catapapa</em>, <em>Dimocarpus longan</em>, <em>Hibiscus tiliaceus</em> and <em>Swietenia  mahagoni</em>) and in buildings during breeding seasons (Chang 2007).  Records are from small secondary forest fragments and settlements in  rice paddy-dominated landscape in the lowland during breeding season. It  has been recorded using nature caves and abandoned tunnels in mountain  area with elevations over 1800 m as hibernacula in India (Chakravarty <em>et al.</em>  pers. comm.) and in Taiwan (Heng-Chia Chang, pers. obs). In Pakistan,  few individuals were captured in a mountainous landscape dominated by  agriculture lands, forest patches and grassland in warm temperate zone  (Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Salim 2015). In Taiwan, a well-studied maternity  colony began to form in late March, and number peaked in May when  pregnant females gave birth with one offspring during May to June. The  bats left the maternity roost sites between mid-August and early October  for hibernation sites (Shen and Lee 2000). The species is reported  mainly feeding on small flying insects, including coleopterans,  lepidopterans, dipterans, hemipterans (Yang 1996) and foraging in rice  paddy (Ying-Yi Ho, unpubl. data) and riparian grassland (Joe Chun-Chia  Huang, pers. obs.) in the lowland.","Not much is known about the global threats of the species due to its  general rarity. In Taiwan, the causes responsible for the wide and  dramatic decline of this species are also unclear. However, several  potential threats have been proposed. The continuous loss of arable land  and uses of pesticide may have threatened the species by loss of food  source. Several types of pesticide residue were detected from the faeces  of this species (Heng-Chia Chang and Chia-Jung Tsai 2013). Since the  species is at least partly cave-dwelling during winter hibernation,  hence the disturbance of hibernacula and climate changes can be threats.  Two roadkill incidences of the species reported from Taiwan (<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://roadkill.tw/"">https://roadkill.tw/</a>)  indicate it is potentially risked by the expansion of road systems and  increasing vehicle volume within its distribution range. A dead bat  found near wind farm in coastal area in western Taiwan suggests the  development of wind energy farms may threaten this species. Domestic  cats might be another threat as a cat-killed incidence is found in  Taiwan (Heng-Chia Chang, pers. obs). Observations in the field show the  presence of artificial light could suppress its emerging from the roost  (Yang 1996). It also tends to avoid artificial light during foraging in  the night (Joe Chun-Chia Huang and Ying-Yi Ho, pers. obs.) suggesting  light pollution may cause degradation of habitats quality, disturbances  to the roost and interference to the migration movement. As it roosts  among foliage, logging also threaten its populations. This species has  conspicuous colouration, hence it may be used as ornament.","It is a generally rare although widely distributed species from northern South Asia to southeastern China and Taiwan (Csorba <em>et al.</em>  2014). It usually roosts as a few to tens animals, although under  specific circumstances it can be relatively numerous, with up to over a  thousand individuals in a single house roost (Heng-Chia Chang, pers.  com.). In Taiwan, continuous and dramatic declines have been observed at  all its largest known colonies. The three colonies containing &gt;100  individuals all experienced a colony size decrease, from ~120-250 to 20  or less. (Heng-Chia Chang and Ying-Yi Ho, unpub. data). Similar trends  of decline were also widely found in ~70% of other smaller colonies  (Heng-Chia Chang unpub. data).",Decreasing,"The species has a rather wide distribution from Afghanistan to Taiwan. Bates and Harrison (1997) and Mandal <em>et al.</em>  (2000) report the species from Afghanistan, India (Jammu and Kashmir,  Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West  Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya and Karnataka). It occurs also in Nepal  (Mahalaxmi and Dhaulagiri), Pakistan, China (Tibet and Jianxi) and  Taiwan. The species has one record from northern Vietnam (Csorba <em>et al.</em>  2014, Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Salim 2015).

The change in status from Vulnerable in the 2008 assessment to Near Threatened must not be taken to reflect an actual increase in population nor a reduction of threats, rather the increasing number of camera trap surveys across Asia have, in recent years, confirmed the presence of previously only suspected populations and in some areas have resulted in a higher than expected number of detections and individuals. Despite this, the Marbled Cat remains little known and, across its range, is recorded relatively infrequently, which has hampered efforts to accurately assess its status, so much so that the assessors could not make a unanimous decision, with some assessors believing that maintaining the status as Vulnerable was more appropriate, we therefore report Near Threatened as the view of the majority. Current data suggest the Marbled Cat is forest dependent but does persist in degraded forest. It is also present over a wide elevation range and in rugged areas – areas in which forest loss is slower than average for the region. Marbled Cats are also threatened by hunting, but currently quantitative data is lacking and we cannot assess the impact this is having on the population. There are no published estimates of population density for the Marbled Cat, however, across its range, density probably varies considerably, but given the large range (currently estimated at roughly 1,500,000 km²) the population density needs to be below one individual per 100 km² to qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals), this seems implausible in several areas. In summary, the population is probably slightly too large and declining too slowly (<em>c</em>. 25%) to qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>If future research challenges these key assumptions (presence in rugged terrain, over wide elevations, large geographic range, tolerance to some habitat degradation) or provides evidence of a substantially fragmented population, extremely low population density, heavy hunting pressure, or stronger support of the proposed species split, the status will need revising and it is likely that it would then qualify for Vulnerable, probably under criterion C.","<p>Current data suggest that the Marbled Cat is forest dependent, primarily associated with moist and mixed deciduous-evergreen tropical forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and may prefer hill forest (Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). The increasing use of camera traps throughout its range is revealing detections from disturbed areas (e.g. Mohamed <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mathai <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2010), including recently logged forest (e.g. Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010), but surveys of oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo have not detected marbled cats within the plantations (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Yue <em>et al</em>. 2015). Grassman and Tewes (2002) reported a pair of adult Marbled Cats in a salt lick in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat has never been intensively studied, but Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2005) report a preliminary home range estimate of 5.3 km² for an adult female who was radio-collared and tracked for one month in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park. There is no detailed information regarding Marbled Cat diet, but it probably preys primarily on rodents, including squirrels (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and birds.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat appears to be primarily diurnal (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em><em>&#160;</em>2013).</p>","<p>  The Marbled Cat is forest dependent and forest loss and degradation is continuing across its range from logging and expansion of human settlements and agriculture, including oil palm plantations. The Marbled Cat is valued for skin, meat and bones, although it is infrequently observed in the wildlife trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, it is possible that illegal killing and trade is underreported compared to other species. Targeted and indiscriminate snaring are prevalent throughout much of the range and likely to pose a significant threat. They have been reported as poultry pests (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mishra <em>et al.</em> 2006) which also results in retaliatory killing. Records of hunting and skins are known from several areas in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India - Vijaynagar-Gandhigram in Changlang district (A. Datta unpubl. data), West Kameng district (Mishra <em>et al.</em> 2006), Pakke Kessang, East Kameng district (Lyngdoh <em>et al.</em> 2011), Ziro valley, Lower Subansiri (Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2013) and from Khonoma in Nagaland (Grewal <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>There are no population density estimates for the Marbled Cat. In most surveys, detection rates tend to be lower for this species than some sympatric felids such as the Asiatic Golden Cat (e.g. Pusparini <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gumal <em>et al</em>. 2014, Than Zaw <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2014) and both species of Clouded Leopard, but higher than others such as the Bay Cat (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). However, in some surveys, when individual animals have been identified, a similar number or even a higher number of individual Marbled Cats compared to Clouded Leopards have been found (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). It is therefore possible that low detection rates may under some circumstances arise from cameras placed inappropriately for Marbled Cats, it is also likely that the population density will vary greatly across the range and it is important to note that many surveys have resulted in very few detections. However, unless population densities are very low, or the distribution extremely patchy it is likely that the total population numbers over 10,000 mature individuals, although this is certainly in decline.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Marbled Cat is found from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal eastwards into southwest China, southwards throughout mainland Southeast Asia and on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.

3498,97165437,4038,Catopuma temminckii,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Asiatic Golden Cat is assessed as Near Threatened. However, there is a general paucity of data for this species, with no density estimates or population data, making an assessment of the true status of the species difficult. The data that we do have indicate that the species has likely experienced population declines of over 20%, and approaching 30% in recent years due to extensive habitat loss and poaching across their range. This pattern is likely to continue in the future, and indicates that the Asiatic Golden Cat is very close to qualifying for a Vulnerable status under criterion A.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat has been documented from twelve countries in Southeast Asia. Yet, despite this fairly wide distribution, its presence in India, Bangladesh and Nepal is limited and patchy (Datta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, with records in both China and Viet Nam declining drastically in recent years (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007; Gray <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm.). It has not been recorded in Viet Nam since 2005, and extensive surveys carried out&#160; in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi Provinces of China have recorded Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Beijing Forestry University unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration unpublished data). It is likely to be extirpated from these two countries in the very near future. The Asiatic Golden Cat is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, but the is thought to be experiencing population declines in these areas as well (Linkie and Ridout 2009, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015, K. Kawanishi pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm).<br/><br/>The most significant threats to the Asiatic Golden Cat are thought to be habitat loss and poaching. Although the species has occasionally been recorded from degraded or altered habitats, it is primarily a forest dependent species, and thus is threatened by the significant habitat loss and fragmentation throughout its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed slightly, they are still among the highest in the world at roughly one million hectares/year between 2000 and 2010 (FAO 2011). Land conversion is also a threat to the Asiatic Golden Cat, and even in countries such as Bhutan, where the species is thought to enjoy a relatively protected status, an increase in hyrdopower projects has the potential to negatively impact the species. Poaching of the species is thought to be increasing in many areas, as it is often targeted for the sale of its pelt and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Khan 2008, Aiyadurai <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Pusparini <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm., P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm., S. Mukherjee&#160;pers. comm., T. Gray&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm., A. Datta&#160;pers. comm., D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Increasingly, the species may be targeted as a substitute for Tiger pelts and bones. In Viet Nam, there have been several incidences of confiscated Asiatic Golden Cat pelts that were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). It is also the victim of indiscriminate snaring and hunting in some areas (Holden 2001, Khan 2008, D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Finally, there are indications that the species is increasingly being killed in retribution for preying on livestock (mainly poultry) (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The lack of reliable density estimates severely limit our ability to accurately assess the population status and trend of the species. However, the decrease, or sudden absence, of Asiatic Golden Cat records from many areas, in combination with an apparently increased level of poaching, lead us to believe that the population is declining across its range. More rigorous scientific data for this species is needed, and may provide a strong basis on which to base change in status to Vulnerable.","The Asiatic Golden Cat is primarily found in forested areas, particularly tropical and subtropical moist evergreen forests, mixed evergreen forests, and dry deciduous forests. (Nowell and Jackson 1996, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Two radio collared individuals (a male and a female) in Thailand occurred most often in closed forest habitats (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). However, the species has also been recorded from open areas such as shrub or grasslands, or open rocky areas, and from degraded or fragmented forest landscapes (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013). A radio collared female in Sumatra was frequently recorded outside of a protected area in remnant fragments of forest located between coffee plantations (McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>Records of the Asiatic Golden Cat have a wide altitudinal variation. The species was documented at elevations up to 3,960 m in the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve Sikkim, India, at 3,738 m in the Jigme Sigye Wangchuk National Park in Bhutan, at 2,896 m in Trongsa, and at 3,900 m in Wangduephodrang (Wang 2007, Bashir <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, S. Dahal pers. comm.). However, in some areas it appears to be more common in lowland forests. In Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra, it was only recorded by camera traps at low elevations.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat is remarkably polymorphic in its pelage. The most common coat color is golden or red brown, but it may also be dark brown or even grey. Melanistic individuals have been reported and may be predominant in some areas of its range (Holden 2001). There is also a spotted form which is called an “ocelot morph” due to its ocelot-like rosettes. To date, this form has been reported from China (in Sichuan and Tibet) and from Bhutan (Wang 2007). The most distinct features of this cat are the white lines bordered with dark brown to black running across the cheeks, from the nostrils towards the cheeks, at the inner corner of the eyes, and up the crown. The rounded ears have black backs with a grey spot. The chest, abdomen and inner side of the upper legs are white with light speckling. The legs and tail are grey to black at the distal ends. The terminal half of the tail is white on the underside and is often carried with the end curled dorsally. Males are larger than females.<br/><br/>Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the Asiatic Golden Cat. It was once thought to be primarily nocturnal, however, recent data indicates that it may be more crepuscular or diurnal. Two radio-collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park showed mainly diurnal and crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). In addition, most camera trap photographs of Asiatic Golden Cats in the Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks in Sumatra were taken during the day (Holden 2001, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The home ranges of two radio collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park were 33 km² (female) and 48 km² (male) and overlapped in significantly (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>One confirmed scat contained the remains of Indochinese Ground Squirrel (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Scats from Sumatra contained rat and muntjac remains, and the stomach contents of a carcass in Thailand's Kaeng Krachan National Park included the remains of a small snake (Grassman 1998).","As a forest dependent species, the Asiatic Golden Cat is threatened by habitat loss throughout it's range. Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed substantially, they are still among the highest in the world (FAO 2011). An increasing number of hydropower projects in countries such as Bhutan, also have the potential to negatively impact the species. In addition, the species is threatened by increasing levels of illegal hunting and poaching for consumption, and for the sale of pelts and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006, Khan 2008, H. Rahman pers. comm., P. Riordan pers. comm., S. Mukherjee pers. comm., T. Gray pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm.). There is thought to be some level of poaching or hunting of the species in every country across its range. Pelts have been recorded being traded along the Myanmar-Thailand border, and in Sumatra (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Pusparini <em>et al.</em> 2014), and skins are reported from several sites in northeast India (Aiyadurai <em>et al.</em> 2010, A. Datta pers. comm.). Poaching pressure is particularly high in China and Viet Nam, where the species may soon face extirpation.  In Viet Nam, there is some evidence that the species is increasingly targeted as a substitute for Tiger skins and parts, as Tigers become more difficult to obtain. There have been several incidences of confiscated Golden Cat pelts which were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox pers. comm.). Snaring appears to be on the rise across much of mainland Southeast Asia, and constitutes a major threat to the species D. Willcox pers. comm.). In Bangladesh, several recent specimens indicate that the species is  commonly hunted by indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Conflict with humans due to livestock depredation is also thought to be an issue for the species. Retribution killing of the species in response to chicken depredation was recorded in Sumatra (McCarthy 2013).","A lack of density estimates across the range makes it difficult to accurately assess the true population status of the species. Owing to somewhat similar camera trap encounter rates, the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to have comparable abundances to those of sympatric felids (e.g. <em>Neofelis nebulosa, Neofelis diardi, Pardofelis marmorata</em>). However, some surveys have recorded the Golden Cat more frequently than sympatric felid species, while others have recorded the it less frequently, so their relative abundance likely varies significantly across their range (Holden 2001, Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Rao <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Lynam <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Mishra <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Bashir <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In addition, it is important to consider that the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to be mainly terrestrial, which may influence the number of camera trap photos recorded in comparison to more arboreal felid species such as <em>Neofelis diardi</em>, <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>&#160;and <em>Pardofelis marmorata</em>.",Decreasing,"The Asiatic Golden Cat has been recorded rarely and patchily from the Northeastern states of India (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim), through eastern Bangladesh (Northeast and the Chittagong Hill Tracts) and eastern Nepal (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lyngdoh <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lalthanpuia <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Borah <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Velho 2013, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, and records in Viet Nam and south China have decreased drastically in recent years, with strong indications that the species may face extirpation there in the next several years (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006; Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan pers. comm.). It is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia (Tempa <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, T. Dhendup&#160;pers. comm., K. Kawanishi&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm.). It is widely reported from the island of Sumatra, but not present on other Indonesian islands (Ridout and&#160;Linkie 2009, Sunarto 2011, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>This distribution may be somewhat generous, particularly in China and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam there have been several Asiatic Golden Cat pelts confiscated recently in local markets, however, they are of undetermined origin. A live individual has not been recorded in the country since 2005, despite numerous camera trap studies. It is likely that the species has been extirpated from most of the country due to widespread and indiscriminate snaring. In China, extensive surveys carried out with local protected area and provincial government teams in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces have recorded the Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Beijing Forestry University, unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration, unpublished data). It is likely that the species is, or will soon be, extirpated from large areas of its range in south China as well.",,Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Golden Cat is listed under Appendix I of CITES (as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Catopuma temminckii</span>), and is officially protected over most of its range by national legislation.

The largest subpopulation had an estimated 1,697 mature individuals in 2011. There is no observed, estimated, projected or inferred continuing decline of the total population. However, stable and increasing subpopulations are restricted to areas with sustainable hunting management and protected areas. Were these conservation activities to cease in the future, poaching would likely increase, possibly changing positive trajectories in these areas downward, and the species would then qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The previous (2008) assessment of Endangered appears erroneous. The data available would have qualified the taxon for the category Vulnerable based on criterion C with &lt;10,000 mature individuals, because the most recent estimates cited by Valdez (2008) ranged from 5,080 to 5,630 (mean 5,355) individuals, of which 60% or 3,213 would have been mature animals. Further, there had been an inferred continuous decline (C1), and in the largest subpopulation in the Torghar Hills there were an estimated 1,600 individuals, of which 960 (60%) would be assumed to be mature, just meeting the threshold of criterion C2a(i) for the category Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The reason for the change from category Vulnerable (the corrected 2008 assessment) to Near Threatened is Genuine (recent, since assessments 1994, 1996 and 2008). Available data show that the earlier population decline had ceased for more than five years due to effective conservation measures. This has led to the stabilization of key subpopulations and increase in parts of the species range. Since 2002, the largest subpopulation has been estimated at &gt;1,000 mature individuals for a number of years. Thus, criteria C1 and C2a(i) for Vulnerable have not been met for five or more years.</p>","<em>Capra falconeri</em> is adapted to mountainous terrain with steep cliffs, between 600 and 3,600 m elevation. The species is typically found in areas with open woodlands, scrublands and light forests. In Pakistan and India these are made up primarily of oaks (e.g. <em>Quercus ilex</em>), pines (e.g. <em>Pinus gerardiana</em>), junipers (e.g. <em>Juniperus macropoda</em>) and Deodar Cedar (<em>Cedrus deodora</em>) as well as spruce (<em>Picea smithiana</em>) and fir (<em>Abies spectabilis, A. pindrow</em>) in certain areas. In Tajikistan the vegetation in the lower parts consists of open woodland and shrub communities with Pistachio (<em>Pistacia vera</em>), Redbud (<em>Cercis griffithii</em>) and Almond (<em>Amygdalus bucharica</em>); with increasing elevation juniper trees (<em>Juniperus seravschanica</em>), (<em>J. semiglobosa</em>), mixed with shrubs of maple (<em>Acer regelii</em>, <em>A. turkestanicum</em>), rose (<em>Rosa kokanica</em>), honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera nummulariifolia</em>) and <em>Cotoneaster spp.</em>. Markhor rarely use the high mountain zone above the tree line. Markhor are diurnal, but most active in the early morning and late afternoon. They alternate seasonally between grazing (summer) and browsing (winter), eating grasses and leaves. Females gestate for 135-170 days and give birth typically to 1-2 kids. The animals are sexually mature at 18-30 months, and live up to 12-13 years. Predators include Wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), Snow Leopard (<em>Panthera uncia</em>), Lynx (<em>Lynx lynx</em>) and on kids Golden Eagle (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>). <em></em>","<em></em><em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></strong></em><br/>Within Afghanistan, Markhor have traditionally been hunted in Nuristan and Laghman, and this may have intensified during the Afghan wars since 1979. According to surveys by WCS in Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008), Markhor continue to be the most important game for local hunters (despite a nominal nationwide ban on hunting). Petocz and Larsson (1977) wrote that rangelands and forests were likely capable of supporting a higher Markhor population than that observed. They assumed that impact of livestock grazing on habitat conditions was limited because the number of domestic animals was restricted by the area's capacity to produce and store winter fodder, as heavy snowfall prevents winter grazing. Recent numbers of livestock are unknown for Nuristan, but recent increases associated with an expanding human population may create competition for forage (WCS 2008). According to a study using recent satellite imagery (Delattre and Rahmani 2007) no large-scale deforestation of the coniferous forests was observed in Markhor habitat in Afghanistan. However, the extent of deforestation for the last five years in a region affected by war and largely out of state control is unknown.<p><br/>In India, all Markhor populations are small (usually &lt; 50) and fragmented. The largest population, in Kajinag, may have potential for long-term survival if immediate conservation measures can be implemented. Key threats to the Markhor’s range are insurgency-related effects, intensified local resource use, poaching, and large-scale development. Poaching by professional hunters may have been the primary cause of decimation of Markhor in the past, but communal hunting during winter was practised until recently. Armed conflicts may have increased poaching by both the military and militants, while poaching by local people may have declined due to confiscation of arms and restriction on human movements. Other pressures come from habitat encroachment by camps of Gujjars and the armed forces, excessive livestock grazing by local and nomadic Bakkarwal herders in parts of the range, and collection of timber and other forest products. Large scale development includes the proposed Mughal road connecting the state capital Srinagar with Rajouri, which passes through the Hirpura Wildlife Sanctuary, and limestone and gypsum mining around Limbar and Lacchipora Wildlife Sanctuaries. The Indian Government has fenced the entire Line of Control with multi-layered barbed wire. This may have caused further fragmentation of populations of Markhor (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>In Pakistan, control of poaching in Chitral Gol National Park and in several community-based conservancies has been successful. There, the population is stable or increasing. However, many subpopulations of Flare-horned Markhor are still small (&lt; 100) and the level of connectivity between them is unknown. The major threat outside established conservancies is poaching.&#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri heptneri<br/><br/></em></strong>In Afghanistan, interviews suggested that within Markhor range overhunting is a considerable problem, with little capacity for enforcement of the national hunting ban (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012). As a result, Markhor appear to be under threat due to unsustainable hunting. (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012) Poaching in adjacent areas of Tajikistan is reported to threaten the source population of Markhor in Shahr-e Buzurg District (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, Michel <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>In Tajikistan, Markhor are poached for meat. There are published reports of skins and horns of about 100 poached Markhor being detected in a camp of Afghan poachers in Tajikistan (Michel 2010). According to Moheb and Mostafawi (2011), hunters in northern Shahr-e Buzurg in Afghanistan told numerous stories of groups of hunters going to Tajikistan to poach, and they showed horns and two skins said to originate from there. Because of remoteness, logistical hurdles and lack of security, the international border in this area remains difficult to control.&#160; Cross-border poaching affects the security situation for game wardens, researchers, tourists, and legal foreign hunters and thus jeopardizes the conservation of Markhor in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve and adjacent areas. A recent report (Alidodov <em>et al.</em> 2014) suggests that in some areas poaching is mainly targeted at mature males (including illegal trophy hunting, Vaisman <em>et al. </em>2014), and that there is a low proportion of adult males (4-5% of the total number, compared to above 20% in other areas). Habitat quality has deteriorated in some locations due to excessive and poorly regulated fuel wood cutting and intensive grazing.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, increasing grazing of goats and intense poaching threaten Markhor (Lukarevski 2002), whereas Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997b) reported that in 1995 grazing and illegal hunting seemed well controlled in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Markhor are now largely restricted to the Surkhan State Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone. Despite their protected status, illegal cutting of trees and shrubs, livestock grazing, and poaching were reported (UNDP 2007). No specific information on the current status of these threats is available, but recent Markhor population data (Xoliqov 2013) suggest that the threats are controlled, at least to some extent.<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros<br/><br/></em></strong>Valdez (2008) reported that in Afghanistan excessive hunting by local people and forage competition with livestock were pushing Markhor to the periphery of its range. Such severe pressure was leading the population to a slow demise, and its status is unlikely to have improved since.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most important threat to subpopulations outside the Torghar Conservancy is illegal hunting. Other threats include competition with livestock, risk of disease transmission from livestock (Woodford <em>et al.</em> 2004), habitat degradation, and habitat loss (Sheikh and Molur 2004). According to Hess <em>et al. </em>(1997), significant habitat loss was caused by logging in the Sulaiman Range, which they considered the most important area of straight-horned Markhor’s distribution. No recent data on the Markhor in the Sulaiman range are available and recent satellite images from 2011 and 2013 (Google Earth, accessed 2014) suggest that habitat conditions in the Sulaiman range are still largely suitable for Markhor.<br/><br/>Another threat for all Markhor subspecies may be posed by the spillover of contagious diseases from domestic goats and other livestock sharing Markhor habitat. Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), a contagious, lethal disease to caprids, perhaps overlooked for long time in the north of Pakistan, was recently confirmed to be present in domestic goats in Gilgit-Baltistan and south-western Tajikistan (Peyraud <em>et al.</em> 2014). <em>Mycoplasma capricolum</em> subsp. <em>capricolum</em>, an infectious bacterium hosted by domestic goats, killed at least 64 Markhor in fall 2010 in one area in Tajikistan (Ostrowski<em> et al</em>. 2011). In India diseases such as foot and mouth disease are reportedly common in livestock and can infect Markhor (Ranjitsinh<em> et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>Hybridization with domestic goats may be a potential threat for all subspecies as goats commonly graze in Markhor habitats. Hammer <em>et al.</em> (2008) found introgressive hybridization with domestic goat among 35.7% of Markhor from three zoos, and speculated that in some cases introgressed wild living ancestral <em>C. falconeri</em> herds may have been the source populations of captive Markhor.</p>  <em></em>","The criteria for Red List Categories refer to mature individuals, but most available population data present total numbers. Here we referred to these total numbers; and for the assessment we assumed that 60% of each population estimate were mature individuals, defined as “the number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of Markhor, this definition excludes kids and yearlings.<br/><br/>The most recent data for most of the species’ range are from different time periods (2008–2014) and of variable quality, including information based on observations, estimates and educated guesses. Data from 2011-2013 are available for most areas, suggesting a total of about 8,800 Markhor. This number does not include some areas for which no data are available for that period. Based on older data and trends we assumed that in total approximately 900 Markhor existed in those areas, for a global population of about 9,700. We therefore assess the global population to be more than 5,800 mature individuals.<br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></em></strong><br/>In Afghanistan, during a survey in April 1972, 37 Markhor were counted in the upper Alingar Valley, and numerous signs of presence and reports by local hunters were documented there and in the upper Alishang Valley, suggesting a viable population (Petocz 1972). In south central Nuristan Petocz and Larsson (1977) recorded 350 Markhor, but considered this number a small proportion of the local population. The observed sex-age structure indicated high reproduction and possibly a fairly stable population size or moderate decline despite hunting pressure. In contrast, in eastern Nuristan Petocz <em>et al</em>. (1977) found a dramatic decline caused by hunting. Camera surveys, hunter interviews, and participatory distribution mapping conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in south central Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2011) suggested that the species was still present in the area surveyed by Petocz and Larsson (1977) and that the occupied range area was still largely the same. Although a 370 km transect survey by the WCS team recorded only three individuals, information obtained from local hunters and the importance of the species as main object of hunting indicated a population at least in the range of up to a few hundred animals.<br/><br/>In India, a survey of the species October 2004 to April 2005 in the Hirpura and Kajinag areas of the Pir Panjal Mountains in Jammu and Kashmir, recorded 35 Markhor groups, comprising 155 individuals (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005). This count, as well as interviews with key local informants, indicated that 350–375 Markhor may have existed in the surveyed area of Jammu and Kashmir. This is slightly higher than earlier numbers of 200–300 (Schaller 1977, Fox and Johnsingh 1997), probably because earlier reports were incomplete guesses based on information from only parts of the Kashmir Valley. The taxon’s range had contracted from about 300 km² in the late 1940s to about 120 km² in 2004–2005. (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009)<br/><br/>For Pakistan, population numbers are available for various time periods and for different locations. Areas were surveyed during different seasons. The numbers we present are based on differing methods (counts, estimates, guesses), and names, locations and borders of specific sites are not always clearly defined. Most recent numbers are available for 2011 and 2012, suggesting a total number of about 4,500 Flare-horned Markhor. More than 1,500 occurred in Gilgit-Baltistan (WCS 2012), 2,959 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Iftikhar Uz Zaman pers. comm. 2014); and Arshad (2011) believed that in Azad Jammu and Kashmir approximately 50 Markhor existed. If these figures are correct, they indicate a substantial increase from the previous Red List assessment (Valdez 2008), when less than 2,500 to 3,000 Flare-horned Markhor were assumed to survive in Pakistan. Approximately 21 years before the current assessment (or about three generations), there were thought to be in total about 2,075-2,575 Flare-horned Markhor, including 1,075 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP 1992) and 1,000-1,500 in Gilgit-Baltistan (NA Forest Department unpubl. information 1993, reported in Valdez 2008). Thus numbers in Gilgit-Baltistan may have remained stable or increased, while the population in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa appears to have increased substantially.<br/><br/>Schaller and Khan (1975) assumed a total of at least 5,250 Flare-horned Markhor living in Pakistan and in India. Petocz (1972) and Petocz and Larsson (1977) counted 387 animals in Afghanistan. The total population number of the subspecies at this time was thus about 5,650 Markhor (about 3,380 mature individuals). Available data suggest that during the period 1985-1993, the total number for the subspecies might have been around 2,950 (1,770 mature individuals). Arshad (2011) assessed the total population number for “Kashmir” Markhor alone at 1,800–2,000 individuals. An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that as of 2012, the total population of <em>C. f. falconeri</em> was close to 5,000 (i.e., about 3,000 mature individuals). Hence the total population of this subspecies apparently decreased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, but since then it appears to have recovered.<br/><br/>Data for specific locations in Pakistan show varying trends of population numbers:<ul><li>In 1970, the Chitral Gol, a valley of 77.5 km² in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province (formerly NWFP), and at that time the private hunting reserve of the Mehtar of Chitral, was estimated to harbour 100 to 125 animals (Schaller and Mirza 1971). In 1984, this area was declared a National Park, and by 1985-86, it contained 160 (recorded) to 300 (estimated) animals. In addition, the proportion of males &gt; 4.5 years in the population increased during the same period (Hess 1986). Within this time span, Aleem (1979) recorded a maximum of 520 animals in Chitral Gol in 1979. The increase was attributed to better protection from poaching and to other improvement efforts in the Park (Malik 1985). However, according to Ahmad (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008), the population in Chitral Gol National Park was reduced to 195 Markhor in 1987. Estimates by Arshad (2011) showed an increase to 373 in 2003 and 590 in 2005/2006. Ali (2008) confirmed the positive trend leading to 612 Markhor recorded in 2006 with a computed annual growth rate of 7.7%. I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population in Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division (including Chitral Gol National Park and its buffer zone, Arshad pers. inf. 2014) from 1,146 in 2009 to 1,364 Markhor in 2012, a greater rate of growth than that suggested by a projection of the data presented by Ali (2008). The precision of these estimates cannot be assessed, as some earlier counts may have been biased low, and the area covered during different surveys might have changed and be thus not directly comparable. Nevertheless, these estimates suggest a substantial increase in the Chitral Gol National Park and adjacent areas.</li><li>For the Tushi Game Reserve (GR) in the Chitral District, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 125 animals, similar to the estimate in 1985-86 (anonymous 1986, Hess in press, quoted in Valdez 2008). In the Tushi Shasha Conservancy, Ali (2008) observed 137 Markhor in 1990 and 545 in 2006, from which he calculated an annual population growth of 7.9%. For the entire Chitral Wildlife Division (without Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division) I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population from 1,049 in 2009 to 1,456 Markhor in 2012.</li><li>The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) estimated 221 Markhor in Kohistan and 58 in Swat of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. According to I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) numbers recorded in Kohistan from 2009 to 2012 varied between 128 and 233, whereas recorded numbers in Swat decreased from 110 in 2010 to 11 in 2012.</li><li>The population of Markhor in the Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary (Gilgit District of Gilgit-Baltistan Province) was estimated by Roberts (1969) as not less than 500 to 600 animals; by Schaller and Khan (1975) as 50; by Rasool (no date, probably 1976, quoted in Valdez 2008) as 109; by Hess (1986) as 50 to 75; and by Rasool (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008) in 1991 as 40-50. In 2012 this population had reportedly recovered to 300 animals (WCS 2012).</li></ul><br/><br/><em>Capra falconeri heptneri</em><br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong>WCS staff surveyed parts of the potential range of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> in Northern Afghanistan in 2011. Due to security problems these surveys covered only small areas. The team observed four Markhor between Payan-e Moor and Aspakha Villages in the Kohe Ghaws area of Shahr-e Buzurg in Takhar Province. Local hunters believed that there were perhaps 20 Markhor left in this area. The interviews in Shahr-e Buzurg strongly supported the historical presence of Markhor in this district: 41 informants from northern and central Shahr-e Buzurg believed that Markhor were abundant in northern Shahr-e Buzurg during the 1970s. In the area between Dahan-e Ab Kof and Leiwgard Village in the Gandamargh Valley (Kuf Ab District in Darwaz, Badakhshan Province), the team observed six Markhor. Interviews with local hunters suggested that this area held approximately 80 Markhor (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>In the ex-Soviet republics, the total population was estimated to be about 1,000–1,200 animals in the 1970s (Zhirnov 1977), generally decreasing in the 1990s to about 700 animals (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997a). However, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997b), based on reports from game wardens and local inhabitants, believed the local population in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve in eastern Turkmenistan increased during the mid-1990s.<br/><br/>Between 1960 and 1970, Zhirnov (1977) assumed that there were approximately 1,000 Markhor in Tajikistan, with the only viable population in the Kushvariston and Hazratishoh Mountains. In contrast, Sokov (1983, quoted in Baskin and Danell 2003) assumed that in 1967 only 500 remained in Tajikistan, decreasing to 400 by 1983. During the late 1980s in the Hazratishoh Range and in Kushvariston (Tajikistan) there were around 350 Markhor (Sokov 1989). Survey data from 2008-2012 (Michel et al. 2014) indicated that the subpopulation in the Hazratishoh and Darvaz Ranges of Tajikistan was stable and likely increasing, with a total of 1,018 recorded in 2012. A survey in 2014 recorded 1,300 in these areas (Alidodov <em>et al</em>. 2014) In the Sarsarak Range a separate population was rediscovered in 2014, with eight Markhor counted and about 30–40 reported by local hunters (K. Karimov pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>During surveys on the western (Turkmenistan) slopes of the Kugitang Range in 1995 and 2000, Weinberg et al. (1997b) and Lukarveski (2002) recorded 227 and 303 Markhor respectively. No recent information from Turkmenistan is available on the population number and trend of this subpopulation. Given the stable or slightly increasing numbers at the eastern (Uzbekistan) slope of the Kugitang Range, we assume that in Turkmenistan currently there are about 250 Markhor.<br/><br/>In the early 1980s there were 400 Markhor in Uzbekistan according to the Red Data Book of Uzbekistan (1983), but in 1994 there were only 270-290 estimated in Uzbekistan, with only 86 counted in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (western slope of Kugitang Range) in May 1993 (Chernogaev et al. 1995). Survey data by the administration of Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve suggested an increase since a low in 2003 (140-150 recorded, 160–180 guessed), reaching its maximum at 310–313 animals in 2013 (Xoliqov 2013).<br/><br/>An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that the recent (2011-2013) total population of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> was about 1,680 Markhor (1,008 mature individuals).<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros</em></strong><br/><br/>In Afghanistan, few animals survived even in the late 1990s, perhaps 50-80 in the Kohe Safi region, with a few in other isolated pockets (Valdez 2008). No recent information is available on the population numbers of Straight-horned Markhor in Afghanistan. The subspecies may be extirpated in the country, but potentially Markhor from Pakistan (e.g., Torghar hills) may cross into Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, population numbers for Straight-horned Markhor are well documented for the Torghar Hills (Baluchistan). Roberts (1969) believed that the main concentration of the Straight-horned Markhor was in the Toba Kakar and Torghar hills and numbers could have been less than 500. In 1984, Tareen estimated that fewer than 200 Markhor remained in the Torghar Hills (Mitchell 1989, quoted in USFWS 2012). The estimate by Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) of 1,684 for 1999 represents a substantial increase compared to Johnson (1997) who estimated there were 695 Sulaiman Markhor in the Torghar Hills in 1994. Rosser et al. (2005) summarized results from surveys that suggested Markhor in the Torghar Hills had increased to over 1,600 by the year 2000. Arshad and Khan (2009) presented an estimate of 3,158 Markhor in Torghar in 2008. M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) considered this estimate possibly biased, and based on a new, conservative analysis of these data, suggested revising this estimate to 1,729. The most recent population estimate of 2,829 in 2011 is from M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>There is no recent estimate for Straight-horned Markhor in other areas in Pakistan, but we assume there to be about 200 <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in other areas of Baluchistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 150 Straight-horned Markhor in the Takatu hills in 1971, but later Ahmad (1989) reported that only 50 still existed in these hills, and only 100 in the area of Koh-i-Sulaiman. In the Ziarat Mountains in Balochistan, Qadir Shah <em>et al</em>. (2010) recorded nine and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) counted 32 Straight-horned Markhor. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) gave a total of only 24 animals for the whole province: 12 for the Mardan area, and 12 for the Sheikh Buddin National Park.<br/><br/>Although an accurate estimate of the total number of this subspecies is not possible, it can be assumed that with the population in the Torghar Hills estimated at 2,829 in 2011 (M. Frisina pers. comm. 2014) the total number might be slightly above 3,000 animals. In the 1990s this total was assumed to be around 870 (Ahmad 1989, NWFP 1992, Johnson 1997 quoted in Frisina and Tareeen 2009, Valdez 2008). Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated that more than 2,000 individuals remained throughout the entire range of Straight-horned Markhor in Pakistan. Roberts (1969) estimated that the total population of the former subspecies <em>C. f. jerdoni</em>, restricted mainly to the Province of Baluchistan, may have exceeded 1,000 animals, but that it was severely threatened because it survived in discontinuous and isolated pockets. For this same area, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated fewer than 1,000 animals. Thus, over the past 20 years, numbers have recovered substantially, but this is known only for one area, the Torghar Hills.",Increasing,"<p>This species is found in northeastern Afghanistan, northern India (southwest Jammu and Kashmir), northern and central Pakistan, southern Tajikistan, southwestern Turkmenistan, and southern Uzbekistan (Grubb 2005). <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri</strong><br/><br/></em>Afghanistan: historically occurred in the eastern portion of the country, in the high mountainous, monsoon forests of Laghman (headwaters of Alingar and Alishang Rivers); Kunar and Nuristan (Habibi 1977, Petocz 1972, Petocz and Larsson 1977) and is still extant at least in south central Nuristan (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>India: restricted to part of the Pir Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009). Populations are scattered throughout this range, starting from just east of the Banihal pass (50 km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu-Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009 observed Markhor only in Kajinag and Hirpura, and confirmed evidence of their occurrence in Boniyar and Poonch. In the areas of Shamsabari and Banihal Pass the taxon is likely extinct.<br/><br/>Pakistan: a&#160;detailed study on the past and present distribution of “Kashmir” Markhor by Arshad (2011) showed that the area of occupancy and the number of locations have declined greatly (approx. 70%) during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, historic ranges larger than present ranges are partly a result of too much generalization in the older distribution maps, which include large sections of unsuitable habitat. It is not clear to what extent exchange takes place between the often small groups of Markhor inhabiting different watersheds. Flare-horned Markhor are mainly confined to the Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the valleys of the Kunar (Chitral) river and its tributaries. According to Schaller and Khan (1975), along the Indus River, Markhor inhabited both banks from Jalkot (District Kohistan) upstream to near the Tungas village (District Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit on the Gilgit River, Chalt and (Haraspo) Sikandarabad on the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley on the Astor River. Currently, Markhor are known from various locations in the Diamer, Astor, Gilgit and Baltistan Districts.&#160;Markhor are&#160;found along the Nagar Hunza River from Sikandarabad downstream, in Naltar Valley, along the Gilgit River downstream from Singul and along the Indus River downstream from Basho to the provincial border with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). Markhor are known to be present in the Juglot Ghooro, Rahimabad and Haramosh valleys in Central Karakoram National Park (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, Ecologist, Central Karakoram National Park, pers. comm. 2014). The population in Haramosh was considered extinct by Arshad (2011), but since winter 2011 Markhor have been observed there (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, pers. comm. 2014), possibly indicating natural recolonization. The distribution range in Gilgit-Baltistan has been updated based on information from various sources (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Flare-horned Markhor were found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan where it inhabited valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River (Schaller and Khan 1975). The distribution range in Chitral has been updated based on Arshad (2011), and includes side valleys of the Indus River upstream from Dubair, the Shishi River Valley as well as the Chitral River Valley and its tributaries upstream from Chitral up to Kaghozi Gol (Mastuj River Valley) and Shogore (Lutkho River Valley).<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri heptneri</strong><br/><br/></em>This subspecies previously occupied most of the mountains lying along the banks of the Upper Amu Darya and the Pyanj Rivers from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan. Currently, it is found in only two or three scattered populations&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">and its distribution has been greatly reduced&#160;(Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997). The subspecies was confirmed to occur as well in Afghanistan on the bank of the Pyanj River (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Afghanistan: almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution before 1979 (Habibi 1977). Reconnaissance surveys and interviews with villagers have shown that, across from the two strongholds of Markhor in Tajikistan, this subspecies exists but in very low numbers in the Darwaz Region (Kof Ab district, ~ 38°02’ N, 70°23’ E) of Badakhshan Province, and in Shahr-e Buzurg District and neighboring Chah Ab District of Takhar Province (~ 37°31’ N, 70°02’ E). The Markhor seem to cross the Pyanj River (which forms the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Tajikistan: limited to the region along the Pyanj River east of Kulyab, southern Hazratishoh range (~ 70°05' E and 37°54' N), including the Kushvariston massif (~ 70°03' E, 37°35' N) and the Pasi Parvor mountains (~ 70°16' E, 37°44' N), and the eastern slope of the southwestern edge of the Darvaz range (~ 70°21' E, 38°05' N, Shuroabad&#160; district of Khatlon Region and Darvaz district of GBAO Region). Formerly markhor were reported from the Babatag Mountains (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Uzbekistan (Ishunin 1972) and from the Sanglak and Sarsarak Ranges (southern parts of the Vakhsh Range, ~ 69°7' E, 38°13' N) (Abdusalyamov 1988). No recent reliable information suggests that Markhor still exist in the Babatag (Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). The presence of Markhor in the Sarsarak Range was confirmed in 2014, but the species has been extirpated from the Sanglak Mountains (Khalil Karimov, Panthera, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Uzbekistan: found in the Kugitang Range (~ 66°36' E, 37°48' N) at the border with Turkmenistan. Its occurrence was reported in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century from the Babatag Range (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Tajikistan (Bogdanov 1992).<br/><br/>Turkmenistan: restricted to the western slope of the Kugitang Range (~ 66°31' E, 37°49' N), bordering Uzbekistan (~66°40’ E, 37°30’ N; Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997a).&#160;<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri megaceros</strong><br/><br/></em>In Afghanistan, at least until 1978, this subspecies survived in the Kabul Gorge (Kabul Province) and the Kohe Safi area of Parwan Province, and possibly in some isolated pockets of Paktia Province. Intensive hunting pressure had forced it into the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range (Petocz <em>et al.</em> 1977, Valdez, 2008). No recent information is available on whether or not the subspecies is still extant in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most comprehensive study of the distribution and status of the Straight-horned Markhor was published by Schaller and Khan (1975). The study showed a huge past range for this subspecies, but the actual range in Pakistan at that time consisted only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan Province, a small area in the former Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), and one unconfirmed occurrence in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). Virk (1991) summarized the information for Baluchistan Province, and confirmed the subspecies’ presence in the area of the Koh-i-Sulaiman (Zhob District) and the Takatu hills (Quetta District), both according to Ahmad (1989). The presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Torghar hills of the Toba Kakar range (Zhob District) has been repeatedly confirmed and it is possible that currently this area holds the only population consisting of more than 100 individuals of this subspecies (Tareen 1990, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Arshad and Khan 2009). Qadir Shah <em>et al. </em>(2010) and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) confirmed the presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Ziarat Mountains in Ziarat District of Baluchistan Province. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1987, 1992) considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. There is no recent information about the Safed Koh range (Kurram and Khyber Districts) where, according to Schaller and Khan (1975) probably at least 100 animals lived on the Pakistan side of the border with Afghanistan in the early 1970s.</p>",See Use and Trade details under Threats.,Terrestrial,"<p>All subspecies and populations of <em>Capra falconeri</em> were uplisted from Appendix II to Appendix&#160;I of CITES in 1992. The 10<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Conference of Parties to CITES in 1997 passed a resolution (Conf. 10.15) allowing for an annual export quota of six Markhor trophies from Pakistan’s community-based hunting management areas to states parties to CITES. CITES increased the annual export quota to 12 in 2002, to further encourage community-based conservation (Resolution Conf. 10.15 (Rev. CoP 14)). The EU Scientific Review Group has expressed a positive opinion on the import of Markhor trophies from well-managed conservancies in Tajikistan (EU SRG 2014).<br/><br/>Within Afghanistan, the species was protected nominally in 2004 (WCS 2008) by a nationwide presidential decree banning hunting, but this ban was not generally enforced. In 2009 the species was listed on Afghanistan’s Protected Species List, making any hunting or trade within the country illegal. The species does not occur in any protected areas. Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>identify remaining populations, their distribution and numbers;</li><li>facilitate the development of community-based conservation in areas with extant populations or with potential for immigration of Markhor from neighboring countries and establish conservation incentives;</li><li>raise public awareness about the conservation importance of the country’s Markhor populations and potential benefits from their sustainable use;</li><li>develop trans-boundary collaboration between nature conservation authorities and community based initiatives, including the prevention of cross-border poaching (Petocz 1972; Petocz and Larsson 1977; Valdez 2008; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012; Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urgent measures are required to conserve the straight-horned “Kabul” Markhor <em>C. f. megaceros</em> if still extant. Surveys to assess numbers and distribution are important. Local people’s support for its conservation is essential, but this will be difficult to obtain, as the initiation of community-based hunting management is currently not possible due to the hunting ban and the difficult security situation in the area.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In India, Markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir’s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978 (Ganhar 1979). Currently, Markhor in India occur in only three small protected areas: the Limber Game Reserve, and the Lachipora and Hirapora Wildlife Sanctuaries. Conservation measures proposed include:</p><p></p><ul><li>raise awareness among the army, policy makers and local people about the rarity of the Markhor and the importance of the region for its conservation;</li><li>the largest Markhor population, in Kajinag, merits the establishment of a protected refuge and the state’s Wildlife Department has already initiated a move to set up the Kajinag National Park;</li><li>involve local people, especially nomadic herders and the armed forces, in the conservation of Markhor, including the realigning of grazing practices so that important areas of Markhor habitat are excluded from grazing, and as much as possible mitigating the larger impacts due to fencing and insurgency (Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009);</li><li>consider future re-introductions to previously inhabited ranges in the Pir Panjal mountains.</li></ul><p></p><p>    </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Pakistan, the Markhor is completely protected by federal law (Rao 1986). In 1991, the Federal government imposed a 3-year ban on all big game hunting. This ban officially lapsed in 1993 but practically remained in effect, although it was ignored in the case of community-based trophy hunting programs (Shackleton 2001). The central government has issued permits only where a community-based trophy hunting program has been established; as of 2000, 80% of the permit fees were mandated to go to the community and 20% to provincial authorities in charge of nature conservation (although inter-community and provincial-federal disputes over receipts and permitting have occurred). The program continued through 2013 with trophy price for Markhor increasing from US $ 18,000 to about US $ 80,000-100,000. According to official records, between 1998 and 2008 approximately US $ 830,000 was distributed to communities within the former NWFP from hunter remittances from the 17 Markhor taken during this period (A. Khan unpublished data, NWFP Wildlife Management, 2008). With higher trophy fees during the last years, significantly higher contributions to the local communities have created substantial incentives for the conservation of Markhor in the participating conservancies. However, the small number of permits issued by the government (up to 12 per annum in accordance to the CITES export quota) may prevent an extension of the approach into still unmanaged areas.<br/></span><br/>In Pakistan several protected areas contain Flare-horned Markhor: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Chitral Gol NP, Drosh Gol GR, Gahirat Gol GR, Goleem Gol GR, Goleen Gol GR, Purit Gol- Chinar Gol GR, Tushi GR (NWFP 1992); Swat District: Totalai GR (Zool.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir - Muzaffarabad: Mauji CR, Qazi Nag GR, Hillan CR (Zool. Survey Dept. 1986); Poonch District: Phala GR (Qayyum 1986). Only one protected area is known to contain straight-horned markhor in Pakistan: Sheikh Buddin NP (previously a Wildlife Sanctuary) in Dera Ismail Khan District of NWFP (Zoological Survey Dept. 1987). The status of the subspecies in protected areas in Baluchistan is uncertain. Its occurrence is not confirmed in Chiltan-Hazarganji NP, and there is no reliable information for either Sasnamana or Ziarat Juniper WS’s. There are no reports of markhor in protected areas in Punjab.<br/><br/>The Torghar Conservation Project in Baluchistan has reduced poaching and competition by livestock (Johnson 1997; Frisina and Tareen 2009); the markhor population in this area is reported to have increased steadily since initiation of the program (Rosser <em>et al</em>. 2005, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Frisina, Montana State University, pers. comm. 2014). The TCP is the oldest community-controlled program in Pakistan and has been so successful that tribal groups in other mountain ranges of Baluchistan have expressed interest in setting up similar programs (Frisina and Tareen 2009, Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Throughout Diamer, southern Gilgit, and Astore Districts of Gilgit-Baltistan community based conservation programs aimed at Markhor conservation have created over 40 community conservation organizations and 18 registered conservancies, and trained and deployed over 100 community rangers. Markhor are now well-protected and appear to be experiencing a significant recovery (WCS 2012).<br/><br/>Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>treat Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary as a focal area for Markhor and enforce protection measures. Kargah is probably the best place for Markhor in the Gilgit District, and like the Chitral Gol, should be rather easy to control because it is a traditional wildlife sanctuary and is close to Gilgit;</li><li>adopt a similar procedure for the area around Bagheecha in the Indus valley, which is one of the best places in Baltistan for Markhor and also relatively easy to control and to the Haramosh and Sikandarabad valleys (in Hunza-Nagar District) in the region of Central Karakoram National Park;</li><li>develop a conservation and management plans that includes information on the status and distribution of <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in the areas it still inhabits outside the Torghar conservancy; consider the area of Koh-e Sulaiman and the Takatu hills as a focal area for conservation efforts and include participatory management in the tribal areas in this plan;</li><li>retain the hunting ban (with its exception for approved community-based trophy hunts);</li><li>encourage the development of community-based hunting management areas in currently unmanaged areas and buffer zones of national parks, and consider a slight increase of the annual quota to ensure more equitable access to benefits from trophy hunts for all conservancies (with quota set on the basis of monitoring results).</li></ul><p></p>    <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Tajikistan, Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik) with an area of almost 20,000 ha was established in 1973, but since the early 1990s poaching has become common, and the security situation deteriorated due to incursions by Afghans (Michel 2010, Moheb and Mostafawi 2011). Markhor are legally protected, but hunting by foreigners was permitted (at least two Markhor/year) in the early 1990s (Weinberg<em> et al.</em> 1997). For the hunting season 2013-2014 the Government of Tajikistan issued a hunting quota of six Markhor, and five were taken by foreign hunters. Hunts are restricted to conservancies established and managed by local small family businesses and community based non-governmental organizations. About 80% of the Markhor recorded by the recent survey (Alidodov<em> et al. </em>2014) were in these conservancies. All captive Markhor in Dashtijum and Romit Strict Nature Reserves and the introduced animals in Romit were poached during civil unrest during the 1990s. </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Proposed conservation measures include:</span></p><p></p><ul><li>strengthening community-based conservation and management through secure rights and obligations for conservancies, issuing of area-specific hunting quotas based on survey results, issuing of import permits for hunting trophies and sharing of benefits with local communities;</li><li>prevention of assignment of hunting rights to non-locals and business structures and of illegal trophy hunts;</li><li>reducing poaching through trans-boundary collaboration, community-based hunting management and law enforcement;</li><li>reducing the risk of disease transmission from domestic sheep and goats by implementing grazing regulations minimizing direct and indirect transmission risks, monitoring the presence of infectious agents in domestic stock and implementing efficient vaccinations on domestic sheep and goats at least against CCPP and Peste des Petits Ruminant disease;</li><li>preservation of the quality of habitat through regulation of forest use and grazing.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Turkmenistan the species is legally protected. Markhor occur in the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik), established in 1986 and covering about 27,000 ha. Lukarevsky (2002) suggested that ecotourism and trophy hunting may provide incentives for the conservation of Markhor. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested enlarging the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve because it protects only the high elevation summer habitat of Markhor and the currently unprotected lower winter ranges are grazed by livestock. Critical for any consideration of a potential trophy hunting programme would be the full involvement of local community members and a benefit sharing mechanism which would ensure their support.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, trophy hunting of Markhor took place in the 1990s (e.g. two in 1994; Weinberg <em>et al. </em>1997) and until about 2005, including hunting in an enclosure containing a small captive group, which no longer exists (S. Zagrebin pers. comm. 2013). The EU Scientific Review Group in 2006 expressed a negative opinion on the import of Markhor trophies originating from the wild, which led to a suspension of trade in 2007. Markhor in Uzbekistan occur in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik). With assistance by a UNDP/GEF project during 2008-13 a managed buffer zone was established, encompassing all current Markhor habitat outside the strict nature reserve. Collaboration between the Kugitang (Turkmenistan) and Surkhan Strict Nature Reserves would be of utmost importance for the conservation management of this trans-boundary subpopulation.</p>  <em></em>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

Throughout Laos remaining populations are eagerly sought by bird trappers,&#160;and the almost total disappearance from North Laos compared with its wide persistence in the South and Centre (albeit largely at low density and with much local extirpation) reflects the much smaller total area of suitable habitat there and its naturally fragmented layout. Habitat loss through conversion to agriculture is extensive, but large areas of suitable habitat remain with now very low population densities (Fuchs<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007; Duckworth and Timmins 2013, 2015; Timmins 2014; J.

It is listed as Near Threatened because it is suspected to be undergoing a moderately rapid population decline owing to on-going habitat loss and trapping pressure.,"This species frequents oak, teak, cedar and pine forest, open wooded hillsides and cultivated areas with tall trees, at up to 3,800 m (Juniper and Parr 1998). In Cambodia, it may more regularly occur in deciduous hill forest, and in areas with evergreen and semi-evergreen vegetation (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2013, R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013), and is noted to be patchily distributed in both lowland deciduous forest and degraded hill forest on the Sen Monorom plateau (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It is noted to use habitats in human-modified open landscapes in some areas (R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013), but in much of southeast Asia it is now restricted to locations close to large areas of remaining intact forest, and this is likely a determinant of successful recruitment throughout the range. In Myanmar, it is described as common in deciduous forest and partly cultivated areas (C. Robson <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It feeds on leaf buds, seeds, fruit and flowers. In central Myanmar, it breeds in January-March (Juniper and Parr 1998).","The species is widely captured for the cage-bird trade and is locally  kept as a pet, for example in Laos and China (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013, M. Zhang <em>in litt</em>.  2013). In China,  poaching and illegal trade of this species continue:  it is reported that in one village, every  family has one individual of  this species as  a pet, and they carry an asking price of  up to US$80  (M. Zhang <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Trapping pressure may also be contributing to the observed decline in Cambodia (F. Goes<em> in litt</em>. 2013). Lowland forests in  Indochina are under intense pressure, particularly  in Cambodia, owing to  clearance for large-scale industrial agriculture.  This particularly  affects areas with evergreen or semi-evergreen  forest, rather than deciduous forest, owing to better conditions for cultivation (S.  Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2013). This species's apparent reliance on patches of evergreen and semi-evergreen  forest may make it more susceptible to the impacts of logging, particularly because it is likely to rely  on large trees for nesting. In habitats where large trees are scarce, such as hill forest and landscapes with a mixture of deciduous forest, patches of evergreen and semi-evergreen forest are under  particular pressure from logging, even for local use (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Habitat loss in Cambodia is expected to have a devastating impact on  this species during the next decade, although there may be a lag before  the true effects are observed in the population (H. Rainey <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In Laos, the species's presence in hilly areas may have buffered it from the worst impacts of logging and habitat clearance (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2013).","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be uncommon in China, with variable status elsewhere (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1997).",Decreasing,"<em>Psittacula finschii</em> is distributed from eastern <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong> and <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, through&#160;<strong>Myanmar</strong>, northern and central <strong>Thailand</strong> and <strong>Cambodia</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong>, <strong>Vietnam</strong> and south-western <strong>China</strong> (central Szechuan and northern Yunnan) (Juniper and Parr 1998). The species is rather patchily distributed across this range, with considerable variation in abundance (Juniper and Parr 1998). The largest population is likely to be in Myanmar, and in parts of the west of the country it has been noted to be the commonest <em>Psittacula </em>(C. Robson&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013,&#160;Collar 2017). &#160;Elsewhere the species is generally uncommon to decidedly rare, being restricted to largely intact forest habitats in southeast Asia and rare in India (Collar 2017). While it is widespread in Thailand (P. Round&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013), mostly in the north, it is uncommon away from protected area complexes (eBird 2017, Collar 2017). It is described as scarce to rare in Cambodia and is absent from large areas of superficially suitable habitat (S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2013, H. Rainey <em>in litt</em>. 2013), but is locally common in Mondulkiri, in the east of the country (Goes 2013, T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It may have been extirpated from south-western Cambodia (Goes 2013). Likewise, its range has contracted in northern Laos, where favoured habitats are fragmented and scarce and trapping pressures are extremely high (Timmins and Duckworth 2013); it remains more widespread in South and Central Laos but even there is widely locally extirpated (J. W. Duckworth <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;It is very rare in Bangladesh, and was believed to have been extirpated; the only recent sighting is from the Chittagong Hill Tracts (S. U.

The rate of forest cover loss has increased in recent years, such that the most recent 5-year annual mean rate is equivalent to a 24.9-25.5% loss of forest cover over three generations between 2016 and 2036. Rapid declines have also been reported in Laos, Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand, with high rates of trapping for food considered to be contributing to declines. As such, the species is assessed as Near Threatened, as it is suspected to approach the threshold for listing as threatened under criteria A3cd+A4cd.","A large frugivorous pigeon that is likely an important seed disperser throughout the range. Occurs in forests, including both primary and secondary, logged forest, forest gardens, mangroves and savannah woodland (Kirwan <em>et al. </em>2020). In most of the range it is a lowland species: mostly below 300 m in India (Rasmussen &amp; Anderton 2005), breeding to 500 m in Sri Lanka (Phillips 1978). There are maximum elevation records up to around 1,000 m in Indonesia, (Eaton <em>et al. </em>2016), 1,050 on Borneo (Mann 2008) and 1,125 m in the Philippines (Dickinson <em>et al. </em>1991), though it predominately occurs in low- and mid-elevation forest in these areas as well (Kennedy <em>et al. </em>2000, Mann 2008, Eaton <em>et al. </em>2016). It occurs up to 1,300 m on Hainan (Lee <em>et al. </em>2005).","In parts of the range hunting may be sufficiently intense to impact populations, as reported on Alor (Trainor <em>et al. </em>2012), and also likely to have driven declines in Laos (Thewlis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998). Hunting is also intense in parts of Hainan (Liang <em>et al. </em>2013). The rapid loss of lowland forest is suspected to be driving considerable declines in much of the range. It has disappeared or become rare in much of Peninsular Malaysia (Wells 1999) as lowland forest has been cleared at a rapid rate, largely for conversion to oil palm plantations. Declines have also been noted in Thailand associated with the loss of plains-level forest, including through dam projects (Round 1988). Similar declines are likely to have taken place in lowland Sumatra.","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be widespread and common  (del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1997). However, extensive habitat conversion in a large portion of the range, coupled with high hunting pressure in certain areas have resulted in significant declines in Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and Laos (Kirwan <em>et al. </em>2020), and rates of forest loss have been moderate to rapid across most of the range, at 17.9% of the year 2000 land cover forest area estimate between 2001 and 2020 (Global Forest Watch 2021). Notably, this rate is increasing, with the 5-year mean below 1% prior to 2011, but 1.22-1.25% for the most recent 5 years (2016-2020) (Global Forest Watch 2021). This annual rate, if sustained, is the equivalent of 24.9-25.5% over three generations (20.4 years). However, in at least parts of the range the species uses secondary and degraded forest, and can use plantations. Logged forest may support higher densities as often abundance of fruiting trees is greater (Johns 1996), but the forest cover loss estimated above is predominately large-scale clearance of forest (Global Forest Watch 2021). As such, the rate of forest cover loss is suspected to approximate the rate of population reduction due to habitat loss for the species. Impacts of hunting may be causing a further increase in this rate of reduction, as noted anecdotally, but there is no assessment of the extent to which the global population is likely to be affected.",Decreasing,"Widespread, occurring from the Western Ghats, southern and eastern India (where it is mostly uncommon or rare), in Sri Lanka (common), east to southern China and patchily in Indochina (absent from much of Thailand and rare in Laos, still fairly common in Cambodia), now rare in Peninsular Malaysia, present on Sumatra, Java (where patchy and uncommon) and Borneo (common in Sabah, and Brunei), the Lesser Sundas (where common in some areas), Sulawesi (common at least in the north and the south-eastern islands) and the Philippines (most abundant in Mindoro and Palawan, scarce on many islands), east as far as Alor and Seram to the south, Talaud and the Philippines further north.","Species is hunted for food in multiple areas, most likely across the majority of the range.

There are populations of the species within many protected areas throughout the very large range. Preventing forest loss within these sites is an essential basic first step: if this is achieved then the rate of population reduction will reduce in line with the relative size of the unprotected extent of suitable forest habitat. In theory, this action is sufficient in itself to reduce the suspected rate of decline in future such that the species risk of extinction is reduced. Hunting is also prohibited in the protected areas within the range, again providing a theoretical buffer to extinction. Remote monitoring of forest loss has enabled the estimation of the current rate of forest loss over the past two decades.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions needed</strong><br/>As with so many species dependent on lowland forest in the region, the key conservation action is retaining the remaining area of intact lowland forest in south-east Asia.

Both could be addressed by surveys at locations in different habitats across the range that derive simple encounter rates of this and all species present coupled with an assessment of hunting intensity.&#160;Regular repeats of distance-based survey at least sufficient to sample each subspecies can achieve this, but careful use of citizen science data may also be able to address some of the data gaps here.

Bioclimatic envelope modelling predicts a reduction in the total area of suitable habitat of nearly 40% by 2070, indicating that rates of reduction are likely to exceed 20% over the next three generations. This is separate from current low estimated rates of forest loss and some localised hunting suspected of causing a current decline in the species' population. Accordingly, the species is assessed as Near Threatened.<br/><br/>Improved information on the distribution of the species strongly indicates that the global population size is unlikely to approach threatened thresholds. Therefore, although the ongoing slow loss of forest cover and localised high hunting pressure may be causing a decline, the species does not qualify as threatened under the small population size and decline criterion. Equally, while the area and likely quality of habitat is inferred to be declining, the species does not approach thresholds under the small range and decline criterion.<p></p>","The species is resident in the undergrowth of evergreen forest, including bamboo, often close to streams, from perhaps as low as 350 m up to 2,500 m, but in Bhutan recent records are only between at 1,000-2,100 m&#160;<strong></strong>(Spierenburg 2005, Dhendup 2015). In Bhutan, its known distribution is almost entirely confined to areas with extensive old-growth forest suggesting that the species may be sensitive to habitat degradation <strong></strong>(P.

Calling birds are heard from mid-March to June <strong></strong>(Spierenburg 2005).<p></p>","Bioclimatic envelope models predict the net loss of 39% of the species's habitat, in eastern Himalayan temperate forest with dense understorey (particularly bamboo), due to shifts caused by climate-change under the RCP 4.5 scenario by 2070 (Bagaria <em>et al. </em>2021). It is unclear whether there is any mitigation or action that can offset this change, beyond preventing additional habitat loss to other drivers. Forest degradation and fragmentation as a result of shifting cultivation, timber harvesting and clearance for tea plantations has affected a small part of the range of the species and is continuing. The species is highly associated with old-growth forest (Spierenburg 2005) and the rate of forest cover loss across the range has been 2.4% over the past three generations (data from Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Beyond this the species may be impacted by fragmentation effects, but potentially unsustainable collection of bamboo or clearance of dense undergrowth may be impacting a larger proportion of the species's range than that showing direct forest loss. Singalila National Park suffers high incursion rates from visitors coming to hunt, collect forest products and graze livestock.&#160;Extensive grazing across much of its range is a further threat. As Bhutan's population increases, shifting agriculture and grazing are likely to become problems within the species's altitudinal range, despite the country's admirable forestry policy<strong></strong>&#160;(Spierenburg&#160;2005). It is suspected that snares set primarily for mammals may also capture a small number of this species: galliformes are frequently captured in this way.<br/><br/>Hunting in the Mishmi Hills (including within protected areas) is apparently severe, although there does not appear to have been a direct record of this species being trapped (Aiyadurai 2012). Interviews in communities surrounding Thrumshingla National Park in Bhutan reported the suspicion of poaching of the species taking place in the National Park (Dhendup 2015). Further infrastructure projects, such as hydroelectric schemes may have caused an increase in trapping and hunting pressure and facilitated illegal logging in addition to direct impacts on habitat through the development footprint and associated infrastructure (A. Rahmani&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).&#160;<p></p>","A previous population size (BirdLife International 2016) is considered to have been an underestimate. The species has been modelled as having an area of suitable habitat between 66,000 and 80,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Bagaria <em>et al. </em>2021), and where dedicated fieldwork has been carried out within this area the species is typically present (although unobtrusive). An investigation into the species in Thrumshingla National Park, Bhutan, provided density estimates of 1.67 (1.27-2.17) individuals per square kilometer based on calling birds (Dhendup 2015), equivalent to a population size of between 80,000-140,000 mature individuals. Consequently, it appears most plausible that the population currently exceeds thresholds for listing as threatened under the population size criterion.<br/><br/>However, this highly-forest dependent species (primarily responding to the presence of dense bamboo rather than canopy cover) has suffered from a low but continuing rate of forest cover loss from within its mapped range over the past three generations, and is known to additionally suffer from high hunting pressure in at least parts of the range such as the Mishmi Hills. In combination, these threats are suspected to be causing a decline in mature individuals, as the population size is considered to be directly related to habitat area and also to be reduced by hunting. But the impact of climate on the future extent of the species's habitat may cause an acceleration in the rate of population reduction: bioclimatic envelope modelling predicts that of current suitable habitat, 47% will become unsuitable by 2070 while only an additional 8% will become newly suitable (Bagaria <em>et al. </em>2021). If these changes are already occurring, this would be the equivalent of a linear rate of loss of 21% over the next three generations, with any impacts from other threats additional to this.",Decreasing,"<em>Arborophila mandellii</em> is endemic to the eastern Himalayas north of the Brahmaputra, and is known from <strong>Bhutan</strong>, West Bengal (Darjeeling only), Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in north-eastern <strong>India</strong>, northern <strong>Myanmar&#160;</strong>, south-eastern Tibet, <strong>China </strong>(MacKinnon and Phillipps 2000, Spierenburg 2005, Zhang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, McGowan <em>et al. </em>2020, Naing&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, eBird 2021, GBIF 2021).

From these values, while they have not been calculated at the correct scale to be considered a valid&#160;Area of Occupancy (AOO: IUCN 2022), it is very likely that an AOO would considerably exceed the thresholds for listing as threatened under the range size criterion. The Extent of Occurrence (EOO: IUCN 2022), a minimum convex polygon around mapped confirmed and probable occurrence polygons based upon multiple sources (Rasmussen and Anderton 2012, Dunn <em>et al.</em> 2016, Zhang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017,&#160;Naing <em>et al. </em>2020, eBird 2021, GBIF.org 2021), is estimated at 227,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The species is highly dependent upon forest habitats, and within the mapped range forest cover loss has proceeded at a slow rate, up to 2.4% over the past three generations (data from Global Forest Watch 2021, using Hansen&#160;<em>et al</em>.

This suggests that there is a continuing decline occurring in the area, extent and also likely in the quality of the species's habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>Bagaria <em>et al. </em>(2021) used their modelled distributions and future climate predictions to predict that this species would be among the Himalayan galliformes most severely impacted by climate change. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, 47% of currently suitable habitat was predicted to become unsuitable by 2070, while only 8% would become newly suitable (Bagaria <em>et al. </em>2021). As such, the rate of habitat loss is suspected to accelerate over the next three generations, and is likely to cause a reduction in the EOO and AOO as well as exacerbating the declines in habitat quality.","The species has been reported to be trapped for food (Dhendup 2015), and occurs in locations where high hunting pressure would be expected to be impacting the species, as found in the Mishmi Hills, Arunachal Pradesh (Aiyadurai 2012).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>It is known from a number of protected areas: Singhalila National Park, Neora Valley National Park and Buxa Tiger Reserve in West Bengal; Maenam WLS (A.

4960,204643889,22695215,Gyps himalayensis,Near Threatened,A3e,2021,2021-07-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has been listed as Near Threatened on the basis that it is suspected that it will undergo a moderately rapid population decline over the next three generations owing to the impacts of diclofenac use in livestock, a drug that has caused drastic declines in other <em>Gyps</em> species and appears to be fatal to this species when ingested. The distribution of this species and existing efforts to reduce diclofenac use may limit the impacts.","This species inhabits mountainous areas, mostly at 1,200-5,500 m (X. Lu <em>in litt</em>. 2016), but has been recorded up to 6,000 m (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In winter it moves lower down, with juveniles wandering into the plains. It feeds on carrion (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1994) and regularly visits carcass dumps in South and South-East Asia (Praveen J. <em>in litt</em>. 2012, T. H. Galligan <em>in litt</em>. 2016, D. L. Yong <em>in litt</em>. 2016).","The most serious potential threat to this species is thought to be mortality caused through ingestion of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) widely used in livestock, particularly in South Asia. Diclofenac has caused drastic declines in three other <em>Gyps</em> species in South Asia since the early 1990s, owing to kidney failure following ingestion, with clinical signs of extensive visceral gout and renal failure, and the drug also appears to be fatal in <em>G. himalayensis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2010). Veterinary use of diclofenac is less common within the breeding range of <em>G. himalayensis </em>so adults are unlikely to be exposed, but juveniles may be when they migrate to lowland areas of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan (Das <em>et al. </em>2010; Bothat <em>et al. </em>2017).

On the Qinghai-Tibet plateau the main threats appear to be chemical control for pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and the removal of livestock carcasses (X. Lu <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Thailand lack of natural food sources has been the sole reason for birds (20 juveniles) being admitted to the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit (C. Kasorndorkbua&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). In Pakistan, increased shrub cover due to a decline in winter grass cutting, promotion of stall feeding of livestock and decreasing nomadic pastoralism may be reducing the visibility of carcasses from the air, while reduced livestock numbers may be further limiting food availability (Siddique and Khan 2016). Electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure is likely to be a threat across much of the range, however there is currently little documented evidence (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017; MaMing and Xu 2015). There is anecdotal evidence of Himalayan Griffons being caught and kept as pets (Sum and Loveridge 2016).

The species has a wide distribution, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, and is presumed to have a large population. However, it is facing threats from deforestation and/or hunting across its range, and although the species has a wider distribution in India than in Sri Lanka, suspected declines due to various threats in the two countries indicates that the species is not Least Concern as it was previously thought to be. The population is suspected to be declining, but at a rate approaching, but not yet meeting, the threatened category thresholds.","This species occurs in tropical primary and secondary rainforests, dry semi-deciduous forests, scrub, swamp, acacia, bamboo, edge, and montane cloud forest up to 2,000 m asl. Understory in dry forests and canopies in wet forests. Also found in home gardens, tea plantations, hotel gardens probably surviving mainly on insects. Two long term studies have been conducted on the ecology and behaviour of this species in India, and one such study has been conducted in Sri Lanka (Nekaris and Bearder 2006, Radhakrishna and Singh 2004). The highest densities of lorises on Sri Lanka occurred in the dry zone forests; also, the presence of species of this genus is positively associated with insect presence, and negatively associated with secondary forest with little undergrowth (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004, Kumara&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/><em>Loris lydekkerianus malabaricus&#160;</em>is found to occur more in cardamom plantations and in degraded and stunted rainforests than in primary rainforests (Kumara&#160;<em>et al</em>.,   2006). This species is characterized by a multi male/multi female   social system of spatial overlap (Sasi and Kumara 2014, Radhakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><em>Loris lydekkerianus lydekkarianus&#160;</em>seems to rely heavily on  undergrowth, and is often found in secondary growth forest (Nekaris and  Jayewardene 2004, Radhakrishna and Singh 2002). Singh&#160;<em>et al</em>.  (1999) found that relatively scrub forests and adjoining croplands are  the preferred habitat types of lorises in the Dindigul Forests of Tamil  Nadu, India. Loris are social with the 38% of activity in association  with other individuals (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013). Though primarily insectivores,&#160;<em>L. l. lydekkerianus</em>&#160;was  found to include plant material, fruits and seeds in their diet  (Radhakrishna and Kumara 2010). There is inter-species home range  variation: Mysore Slender Loris adult males ranging 3.6 ha and&#160;&#160;1.6 ha  for adult females. Roving males can have home range as large as 117 ha.  Ranges might overlap for males but not so for females which are almost  ‘exclusive’ (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><em><br/></em>Prior to taxonomic revision in 2020 (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2020), three subspecies were recognised in Sri Lanka: <em>L. l. grandis</em>, <em>L. l. nordicus</em> and <em>L. l. uva</em>.

This species is characterized by a multiple-male/multiple-female social system of spatial overlap. They sleep in groups of up to seven individuals and interact commonly throughout the night (Nekaris 2006, Radhakrishna 2001). <em>Loris lydekkerianus nordicus&#160;</em>is very well studied in captivity (Schulze and Meier 1995). They are primarily insectivorous (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004) and are  apparently able to survive well near human habitations (Nekaris and  Jayewardene, 2003), as <em>L. l. nordicus</em> was found more often associated with disturbed  human habitation than with forest (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004).<br/><br/>L<em>oris lydekkerianus grandis</em> much prefers undisturbed forests than disturbed forests and this may cause its patchy distribution. It is found in a wide variety of habitats, including low wet evergreen forests, moist mixed evergreen forests, dry riverine forests, mid-elevation evergreen forests and a small portion of montane evergreen forests (Gamage&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). Phillips kept&#160;<em>grandis</em>&#160;in captivity, reported it feeding on tree frogs, geckoes, and various kinds of insects, and it was mainly carnivorous (Phillips 1998, Nekari and Jayawardena 2004).<br/><br/><em>Loris lydekkerianus uva</em>&#160;is very rare but common in pristine undisturbed moist mixed evergreen forests (Gamage <em>et al</em>. 2017).","Severe habitat loss in Sri Lanka and India threatens this species (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2003, Nekaris and Schulze 2005, Nekaris and Bearder 2006).

Relative abundance of&#160;<em>L. l. malabaricus</em>&#160;in Kerala is &lt;0.2 lorises/km, except Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, Konni, Thiruvanthapuram, Nemmara, and Chimmoney.&#160;<strong></strong>The encounter rate for&#160;<em>L. l. malabaricus</em>&#160;is 0.21 animals/km&#160;(Sasi and Kumara 2014, Radhakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Although&#160;<em>Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianu</em>s is widely distributed, it is highly fragmented, except for a few places where populations are contiguous due to habitat contiguity. The density is very high in certain fragments due to lack of space for the dispersal; for example, 0.16 individuals/ha in Devrayandurga State Forest to 2.57 individuals/ha in Ippadi State Forest with highest density of 165 individuals /km² in Tumkur Forest Division. Ujjaini, Ippadi, Nagavalli, and Savanadurga have high densities of Slender Lorises at 1.85 individuals/ha. Such high densities are found in small patches and therefore cannot be extrapolated to area of occurrence.&#160;In some localities of the Eastern Ghats, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the population densities of&#160;<em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">L. l. lydekkerianu</em>s are rather high, although not as high as in Dindigul region (Singh&#160;<em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">et al.</em> 2000, Kumara <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Prior to taxonomic revision in 2020 (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2020), three subspecies were recognised in Sri Lanka: <em>L. l. grandis</em>, <em>L. l. nordicus</em> and <em>L. l. uva</em>. These are no longer recognised as separate taxa (and are now synonyms of <em>L. l. lydekkerianus</em>),  however since this Red List assessment was carried out in 2015,  populations previously identified as these taxa are referred to by their  former subspecies names below.<em></em><br/><br/>Nekaris and Jayewardene (2003, 2004) carried out a survey of Slender Lorises in Sri Lanka. In this study population densities of the animals were estimated using animal encounter rate (ex: animal/km).&#160;According to these authors,<em> </em><em>L. l. nordicus&#160;</em>had an encounter rate of mean 3.6 loris/km (range 0.33 to 50/km), whereas <em>L. l. grandis&#160;</em>was encountered at a mean of 0.42 /km (range&#160;&#160;0.11 to 3.3/km). The greater prevalence of&#160;<em>L. l. nordicus</em>&#160;than&#160;<em>L. l. grandis</em>&#160;had been noted earlier by Petter and Hladik (1970) who estimated a density of one loris per ha (100/km²) for&#160;<em>L. l. nordicus</em>&#160;in the dry zone forest at the Polonnaruwa Sanctuary, but far fewer <em>L. l. grandis</em>&#160;at 0.2 loris/ha (18/km²) in the wet zone hills of Udawattakelle Santuary of Kandy. Local populations that were formerly identified as <em>L. l. nordicus</em> can be relatively high; for example, in the protected forest surrounding the Smithsonian Primate Research Station at Polonnaruwa, densities may reach 3-5 loris/ha (300–500/km²) (WPJ Dittus, pers comm), somewhat greater than the density of 1/ha observed in the Polonnaruwa Nature Sanctuary (Petter and Hladik 1970).<br/><br/><em>Loris lydekkerianus grandis</em> much preferred undisturbed forests than disturbed forests, which may cause its patchy distribution (Gamage&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). According to Nekari and Jayawardena (2004), mean abundance is 0.42 /km (range&#160;&#160;0.11 to 3.3/km). Phillips kept <em>L. l. grandis</em>&#160;in captivity and reported it feeding on tree frogs, geckoes, and various kinds of insects, and it was mainly carnivorous (Phillips 1998, Nekaris and Jayawardena 2004).<br/><br/>Nothing much is known about the population of <em>L. l. uva</em> except that it is suspected to be declining due to severe threats to the habitat.</p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"The species occurs in southern and eastern India (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>It is suspected that the extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are both declining for the species due to ongoing habitat degradation and loss. For example, India has lost 19% of tree cover from 2002 to 2019 (Global Forest Watch 2020). Meanwhile, Sri Lanka lost 5.7% of its total tree cover during the same time period (Global Forest Watch 2020).","This species is traded in India due to superstitious beliefs among many locals. Lorises are used for various dubious practices such as selecting horoscopes, sacrifices, black magic, and to ward of evil eye. In some instances lorises are caught and killed for improving eyesight in humans (Smitha Daniel, pers. comm.).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix II, and classified under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act (1972). In India, very few populations are found in protected areas, and the majority of the population occurs in private lands and commercial plantations (M.

Singh <em>et al</em>. (1999) also suggests more detailed surveys in different forest blocks and habitat types in order to obtain quantitative data on densities and distribution.

While its population is suspected of still being relatively large, trapping for the cagebird trade is ongoing at a scale thought to be driving moderately rapid declines: this is especially true in Indochina, where populations in Lao PDR and Viet Nam have declined very rapidly over the past three decades. In some range states (particularly India and Thailand) populations may be stable or declining only slowly. Habitat loss and degradation may be an additive threat to this species especially in South-East Asia where the species has a strong affinity to lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest. Evaluating its global status, the species is assessed as Near Threatened due to rates of population reduction suspected to approach the threatened thresholds. The impacts of trapping must be monitored closely, especially alongside evidence of population declines in range states where the species is currently considered comparatively secure.","This species occurs in the lowlands to c.1,500 m, inhabiting light forest, including savanna, secondary growth, forest edge, clearings and cultivated areas (Juniper and Parr 1998). It is particularly associated with dry deciduous forest throughout south-east Asia (Goes 2013, R. J. Timmins <em>in litt</em>. 2013); although it is occasionally observed in semi-evergreen forest, it seems to be dependent on drier habitat (Goes 2013, W. Duckworth <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is able to persist in partially deforested landscapes and appears to favour forest edge near cultivation (Juniper and Parr 1998). It breeds in January-May, nesting in tree cavities and laying a clutch of usually 4-5 eggs (Juniper and Parr 1998).","Capture for the cagebird trade is the chief threat to this species throughout its range, having caused the near-extirpation of it from parts of its range (e.g. Lao PDR: Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press.). There are few empirical examples of the scale of this trade, although at a single site in Myanmar between December 2018 and April 2019,&#160;1,744 individuals were reported for sale from (Thin Thin Khaing 2019). It is also obscure what percentage of the trade in this species is international, although the appearance of birds in markets in Indonesia (not a range state) (Chng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018) suggests that to some degree, birds are traded internationally. Although the species is listed in CITES Appendix II, there are very few trade records (CITES Trade Database 2023: all from Europe and likely refer to captively bred birds) suggesting that this mechanism is ineffective at monitoring trade currently. Habitat loss and degradation is considered a secondary threat. This species is very tolerant of habitat degradation and occurs, for example, in forest edge interspersed with cultivation (Juniper and Parr 1998). However, at least in South-East Asia, the species shows a strong affinity for lowland deciduous dipterocarp forests which have been subject to some of the most intensive habitat modifications in Indochina. Accordingly, habitat loss has locally likely contributed to some extent to declines; Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press.) considered in Lao PDR that although habitat loss and degradation is unlikely to have been a proximate cause of population collapse, it ""could perhaps limit any future recovery if hunting is controlled"".","The global population size has not been quantified, but the overall abundance appears to be much reduced across its range in recent decades (Collar and Kirwan 2017). In Lao PDR and Viet Nam, now very scarce (Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press., eBird 2023), but in India, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia it remains locally common (Goes 2013, Thin Thin Khaing and Khin Myint Mar 2019, eBird 2023).",Decreasing,"Blossom-headed Parakeet occurs in South and South-East Asia, ranging from <strong>Nepal </strong>(most recent records from Chitwan National Park: eBird 2023), east through the Himalayan foothills to north-east&#160;<strong>India</strong> and south to eastern<strong> Bangladesh</strong><strong></strong>, through most of&#160;<strong>Myanmar</strong>&#160;and neighbouring western Yunnan, <strong>China</strong>.&#160;It is widespread in&#160;<strong>Thailand </strong>(north of the peninsula) and <strong>Cambodia</strong>, but is highly localised in <strong>Lao PDR </strong>and <strong>Viet Nam</strong>, where now only known from sporadic records in the south of both countries. Similarly, there are no recent records from Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in southern China, despite historic occurrence there. Although the species is yet to have been entirely extirpated from any range state, the overall EOO is thought to have reduced from 3,870,000 km<sup>2</sup> three decades ago, to only 2,670,000 km<sup>2</sup> now. If the current threats continue, extinction in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are possible.<br/><br/>Given this species' use in the pet trade, it is perhaps unsurprising that this species occasionally escapes and turns up elsewhere. For example, there are several records from urban centres including Singapore and Hong Kong (eBird 2023) but it is not considered established here or anywhere else outside its native range. It is mostly sedentary, with some localised seasonal movements (presumably in response to food pressures).","Capture for the cagebird trade is the chief threat to this species throughout its range, having caused the near-extirpation of it from parts of its range (e.g. Lao PDR: Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins <em>et al</em>. in press.).

Listed in CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Because habitat loss and degradation are considered only secondary threats for this species, the most important threat to address is that of trapping. In particular, this species should be protected in all range states and those where it is must ensure legislation is upheld. There is an urgent need to better quantify the impact of trade on wild populations. Long-term, the most successful way to address trapping is with community engagement, in particular, the need for awareness-raising activities to discourage nest-robbing and trapping. Timmins <em>et al</em>. (in press.) noted that in Lao PDR, habitat degradation may now or soon be at a scale that limits recovery potential; accordingly, although this species <em>is </em>tolerant of fragmented and degraded forest landscapes, there is undoubtedly a need to robustly protect areas of dry deciduous forest for this and other species dependent on this biome.
