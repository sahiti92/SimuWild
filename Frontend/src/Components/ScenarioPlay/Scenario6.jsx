            Translocation of Asiatic Lions from Gir National Park
          </h1>
          <p className="scenario-description">
            Gir National Park in Gujarat is the last remaining habitat of the
            Asiatic lion, a critically endangered species. Due to concerns about
            the species' vulnerability to disease outbreaks or natural disasters
            in a single location, conservationists have recommended the
            translocation of some lions to a second habitat. However, the
            translocation plan has faced resistance due to political,
            ecological, and social factors. In 2018, the death of over 20 lions
            due to a canine distemper virus outbreak further emphasized the need
            for creating a second, secure habitat. The userâ€™s task is to find a
            balance between translocation and protecting the lion population in
            its existing habitat.
