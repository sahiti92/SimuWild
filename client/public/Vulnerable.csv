242,1491874,177540,Ophiophagus hannah,Vulnerable,A2acd,2012,2011-09-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Ophiophagus hannah</em> has been assessed as Vulnerable. This species has a wide distribution range, however, it is not common in any area in which it occurs (with the apparent exception of Thailand, and there only in forested areas), is very rare in much of its range, and has experienced local population declines of over 80% over 10 years in parts of its range. Pressure on this species from both habitat loss and exploitation are high throughout this snake's range, and while no quantitative population data is available, it can be conservatively estimated that the population size has declined globally by at least 30% over an estimated three-generation period of 15-18 years. More detailed population monitoring in the more poorly-known parts of this snake's range may reveal that this is a conservative estimate.","This species is found in a variety of habitats, primarily in pristine forests, but it can also be found in degraded forest, mangrove swamps and even agricultural areas with remnants of woodland. It has also been found swimming in rivers in non-forested land and probably occurs in palm oil plantations (R. Inger pers. comm. 2010), however it is not yet clear whether oil palm plantations can support viable populations of this species (M. Auliya pers. comm. 2011). In India, this species has also been recorded from tea estates in the Western Ghats and Assam (Whitaker and Captain 2004). In Nepal this species is poorly-known, but has been reported primarily from undisturbed Sai forest and from dry high-altitude grasslands (D. Jelić pers. comm. 2012). Females build nests of dead leaves and stay with the eggs until they hatch, which takes 70 days at 28²<sup></sup>C (Whitaker and Captain 2004). Reproductive age in captivity has been estimated at 5-6 years, and this is here conservatively taken to be the generation length in the wild population, although true generation length is probably longer. One individual was reported to have a 6.3 km² home range (Bhaisare <em>et al.</em> 2010), indicating that the species is likely to occur in low population densities, although it is unknown whether this is natural or a result of the depletion of wild populations.","This species is threatened by destruction of habitat due to logging and agricultural expansion, as Southeast Asia is experiencing one of the highest rates of deforestation in the tropics (Sodhi <em>et al.</em> 2009) and this species appears to be most abundant in forested habitats. Snakes can however survive in a range of degraded habitats and so this is unlikely to be the primary threat to this species globally,. The extent to which degraded areas can maintain viable populations of this snake is unknown; in the Chitwan area of Nepal it has been observed that mostly young animals are encountered in agricultural lands, always close to forest, and these areas may simply be feeding grounds, or may be population sinks (D. Jelić pers. comm. 2012). Deforestation is however likely to exert strong pressure at local scales, particularly where snakes are also hunted, and is likely to lead to declines in many of the snakes on which this species feeds (R.P.H. Lilley pers. comm. 2011). In Nepal, the Therai lowlands have undergone a rapid increase in population since the eradication of malaria from this region, and most of this area is now under cultivation or exposed to pollution, with forests remaining only in protected areas (D. Jelić pers. comm. 2012). The king cobra is, however, particularly at risk from the harvesting of individuals for skin, food, pets, and especially traditional Chinese medicine. As the world's largest venomous snake, it is also suffers high levels of persecution by humans throughout its range. The possibility of this snake actually representing a complex of species makes all of these threats even more acute, as individual species within the complex will occur over a smaller area and as smaller populations than the currently recognized <em>Ophiophagus hannah</em>.","The snake remains common in good habitat in Thailand, where it is a  protected species, with no evidence of declines (T. Chan-ard pers. comm. 2011). However, this species is not frequently encountered anywhere else within its wide range.&#160;A population reduction of 30% over 75 years in India has been inferred from the numerous threats to this species, including habitat destruction and harvesting of mature individuals from the wild. A study in northwestern India showed that even though the species has been recorded in diverse habitat types, analysis of observations revealed that the abundance of king cobras is strongly linked to the availability of undisturbed forests (Das <em>et al.</em> 2008), indicating that the destruction of natural forests is likely to be causing significant declines in this species' population. In Nepal, a ""very sharp decline"" in larger individuals has been observed, which is likely to affect the population's reproductive fitness as large female reptiles typically produce the majority of offspring that survive to reproductive age (D. Jelić pers. comm. 2012). Local reports indicate that very large individuals can no longer be found in the Chitwan area of Nepal (D. Jelić pers. comm. 2012). In Viet Nam, the national Red Data Book estimates that this species has declined by more than 80% over 10 years as a result of habitat loss and overharvesting for the leather trade (Dang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The surviving population of this snake in Viet Nam may be very small (Q.T. Nguyen pers comm. 2011), as it is encountered more rarely in forest surveys than in the past. The species is rarely seen in Cambodia; T. Neang (pers. comm. 2011) reports as few as three sightings in this country over ten years of surveys. Similarly, only three or four have been recorded in twelve years of recent surveys in Myanmar (G. Wogan pers. comm. 2011).&#160; It is very rare in Indonesia based on data from trade, where it is very much less frequently seen than species of <em>Naja</em> (M. Auliya pers. comm. 2011). The wild population in China was considered to be “very low” in the 1990s  (Zhou and Jiang 2004), which very probably reflects the impact of exploitation and trade of this snake in  China for medicinal purposes. The snake is considered to have declined by over 50% over ten years in this country as a result of exploitation for both subsistence and regional trade (Wang and Xie 2009). Population sizes in Peninsular Malaysia are reportedly small (L. Grismer pers. comm. 2011). Very little information is available on the status of the king cobra in Bali, where it was first reported by de Haas (1950). Presently, subpopulations appear to be small and fragmented, with the snake only known definitively from Negara in the island's west and from Bali Barat National Park. Due to hunting pressure and, particularly, deforestation for agricultural conversion, the snake is likely to be declining on this island (R.P.H. Lilley pers. comm. 2011).",Decreasing,"The King Cobra is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia, from Nepal (where it is found throughout the lowlands of the Therai region - Schleich and Kästle 2002) and India (from  Uttarakhand in Western Himalayas to Eastern Himalayas, down south along the  Eastern Ghats up to northern Andhra Pradesh, and in the Western Ghats south  of Maharashtra) across southern China (including Hainan Island), southward to the Philippines (where it is widespread) and Indonesia east as far as Sulawesi and Bali (where there are recent records from Negara [R.P.H. Lilley pers. obs. 2011]; Smith 1943, Zhao and Adler 1993, David and Vogel 1996, Whitaker and Captain 2004), as well as the Malaysian territories of Sarawak and Sabah, and Brunei (where a recent record exists from Kuala Belalong Field Centre - J.M. Dehling unpubl. data), on the island of Borneo. It occurs in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, but is absent from Little Andaman and from the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra. It has a maximum recorded elevation of 2,000 m asl. (Smith 1943).","This species is harvested for skin, food, and especially medicinal purposes in China. It is heavily harvested for the medicinal trade in many parts of its range, particularly Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Myanmar, both for domestic purposes and for export to China. It is also traded in Java and exported to China for medicine, local  consumption and trophies, which is not traceable and so is unregulated (M.  Auliya pers. comm. 2011). In Bali, hunting takes place primarily to supply zoos and international collectors, but the snake is also occasionally found for sale in snake restaurants (R.P.H. Lilley pers. obs. 2011). It is also used in snake wine in Vietnam (Somaweera and Somaweera 2010). It is found in the domestic and international pet trade throughout its range (M. Auliya pers. comm. 2010). Between 2000 and 2011, there was an annual quota of 90 specimens for the pet trade in Indonesia.&#160; Almost 2,000 live animals were exported for the pet and venom trade between 2000 and 2009 from Indonesia, and internationally the medicinal trade in this species is considerably larger. Three thousand specimens from Myanmar, reported to have been ranched, were found in a single shipment from Myanmar to Vietnam in 2006 (CITES trade data), although researchers in this area are unaware of the existence of snake farms in Myanmar (G. Wogan and M. Auliya pers. comm. 2011). The major exporting countries for the pet trade are Indonesia and Malaysia, although it is exported from Peninsular Malaysia only in small numbers (L. Grismer pers. comm. 2011).",Terrestrial,"The species is listed in CITES Appendix II. This species has been regionally assessed in India, China and Vietnam. The Regional India preliminary assessment of Near Threatened was made by the BCPP CAMP, while in China it was assessed as Critically Endangered in the national Red Data Book, and as Endangered in the China Species Red List (Wang and Xie 2009). It is listed as Critically Endangered in the national Red Data Book for Viet Nam (Dang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007), where it is a protected species. There are protected areas within the range of this species which probably provide small safeguards from harvesting pressure. Conservation measures are required to reduce the rate of habitat destruction occurring within its range and to manage the trade levels of this species. Further research into, and monitoring of the population status of, this species is required, as well as research into sustainable harvesting levels. Taxonomic research is also needed to determine if this species actually consists of a complex of species. Educational programmes may help to minimise the persecution of the species. In Royal Chitwan National Park the King Cobra is included in a new project focusing on ecological monitoring of and providing education about large reptiles, run by Nepal's National Trust for Nature Protection, the park authority, and the Zoological Society of London (D.

In summer, Takin feed in alpine meadows up to 4,000 m.  In winter they descend into the valleys and forests to as low as 1,000 m.  They feed on a variety of grasses, bamboo shoots, forbs and leaves of shrubs and trees.  Takin forage in early morning and late afternoon, and regularly visit salt-licks which renders them very vulnerable to poachers who lay in ambush.  Takins seasonally migrate to preferred habitats.  During spring and early summer months, they begin to gather in large herds of up to 100 animals at the uppermost limits of treeline.  During cooler autumn months, when food is less plentiful at higher elevations, herds disband into smaller groups of up to 20 individuals, and move to forested valleys at lower elevations.  Groups mainly comprise females, subadults, young and some adult males.  Older males usually remain solitary throughout most of the year, but gather with females during the rutting season.  Sexually mature at about 3.5 years of age. Rutting occurs in late summer, followed by a gestation of 200 to 220 days.  Single young are born in March or April.  Longevity is about 16-18 years.<br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi</em> inhabits in temperate forest and coniferous forest from 1,300 to 2,800 m in the Foping Nature Reserve, and make seasonal vertical movement (Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2008). They feed on 163 species of plant, including grasses, bamboo shoots, forbs and leaves of shrubs and trees (Zeng and Song 2001). Breeding season starts in early June and lasts to the end of July with a peak from middle of June to middle of July (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2005). Newborn calves are observed in February and March.  Mean group size was 10.84 (n=96), the male:female ratio was0.49:1 (Zeng <em>et a</em>l. 2002). Solitary males were observed during the breeding season; most solitary, old males were seen during winter in lower elevation. Sexually maturity occurs at 4.5 years of age for female and 5.5 for males in wild populations of <em>B.t. bedfordi</em>.","<em>Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi</em><br/>Deforestation, hunting, disturbance, and habitat fragmentation are continuing concerns (Wang 1998).<br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor taxicolor</em><br/>In Tibet, China, hunting is the main threat, but habitat destruction caused by deforestation is also serious (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1997, Wang 1998). In Myanmar populations are threatened by for bushmeat (by trapping and crossbow; Salter 1997). <br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor tibetana</em><br/>Overhunting has resulted in local extirpation of this takin in some areas of its range, and recovery has been slow despite legal protection measures. Habitat loss and disturbance from tourism are also significant threats. <br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor whitei</em><br/>With almost no management or protection in the remote border areas of China, over-hunting by local people is hard to control, and hunting of large herds in winter is reported to be a serious problem (Feng <em>et al</em>., 1986). In Bhutan, threats include competition and disease transmission from domestic livestock, habitat loss (pasture burning), and loss or disruption of migration routes. In India, major threats come primarily from habitat loss resulting from activities such as timber harvesting, cane and bamboo cutting and road construction, all associated with human populations that continue to encroach on areas occupied by takin. Local people are also known to hunt takin regularly, both within and outside protected areas. Recent surveys of takin found evidence of hunting in the Siang Valley and Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary but only limited sign of the animals themselves, whereas in Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, considerable numbers of takin tracks and droppings, and evidence of hunting were found (Katti <em>et al</em>., 1990). Current levels of hunting by local residents may not represent a significant influence on takin populations (Katti <em>et al</em>., 1990).","<em>Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi</em><br/>The total population size in China was estimated as 21,200 individuals by Ge (1990), but a later effort by provincial officials in Shaanxi estimated 5,069 (range: 4,418-5,720; Forestry Bureau of Shaanxi Province 2001).  Three centers of relatively high population density occur in Taibai, Ningshan and Zhouzhi, where they are restricted to the upper catchments areas of several rivers (Wu <em>et al</em>., 1987). In 1974, a field survey of five areas gave the following numbers of takin: Fuping - 104; Taibai - 191; Yangxian - 225; Zhouzhi - 587; and Ningshan - 135 (Total 1,242) (Wu <em>et al</em>., 1987).  A census by counting individuals in Foping Nature Reserve from April to July 1996, there were 435-527 individuals there with a ratio of adult females: subadults: calves of 1:0.99: 0.35 (Zeng <em>et al</em>. 1998). <br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor taxicolor</em><br/>No rigorous estimate has been made of the total population in China, but Wang (1998) estimated about 3,500, mostly in Tibet. In Myanmar populations are decreasing because of hunting for bushmeat (by trapping and crossbow), and is now rare (Than Zaw pers comm. 2006).<br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor tibetana</em><br/>No total population estimate in China has been made, but several thousand animals are believed to inhabit the Qionglai and Min mountains. A survey of Sichuan takin populations carried out in 1975 in the Wolong and Tangjiahe Nature Reserves (Qingchuan county), estimated 191 (Wu <em>et al</em>., 1987) and 370 to 410 (Ge <em>et al</em>., 1989) animals, respectively. Large herds numbering as many as 45 to 100 individuals have been seen occasionally in Tianguan, Baoxing, Pingwu and Qingchuan. Other population observations estimate the young to account for 17.8%, the sub-adults for 13.3% and the adults 68.9%, while the adult male to female sex ratio is 2:1 (Wu <em>et al</em>., 1990; see also Schaller <em>et al</em>., 1986).<br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor whitei</em><br/>There is no known estimate of population size or trend for B. taxicolor whitei within China, Bhutan, or India.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in Bhutan, China (southeastern Gansu, Sichuan, Shaanxi, southeast Tibet, and northwestern Yunnan), and northeast India (Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim; Singh 2002) and northern Myanmar (Salter 1997).<br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi</em><br/>This golden takin is confined to the Qinling mountains in southern Shaanxi, China where distribution records of its occurrence have been collected throughout mountain ranges between elevations of 1,500 to 3,600 m.

In Tibet, the western boundary is formed by the great bend of the Yarlung Zangbo (Tsangpo) river, where it occurs south of Medog on the mountain slopes on the border with Arunachal Pradesh (India). It enters China again southeast of here in northern Yunnan, where it inhabits the Gaoligongshan range which lies between the west side of the Salween (Nu) river and the Sino-Myanmar border. This eastern section of its distribution extends from around Gongshan in the north, south to include Fugong, Lushui, Tengchong, Baoshan and at least as far as Longling (Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986; Wu <em>et al</em>, 1987). In Myanmar, it occupies the high mountain slopes above 2,750 m in Kachin State, northern Myanmar, to the border with China (Blower, 1985, Salter 1997). However, there is no recent distribution data. The geographic boundary between <em>B. t. taxicolor</em> and <em>B. t. whitei</em> is evidently uncertain.<br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor tibetana</em><br/>Sichuan takin is found along the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. Here, its distribution runs from the Min mountains along the Sichuan-Gansu provincial border, south through the Qionglai mountains west of Chengdu to the border with Yunnan Province. Records of this takin have been found from more than 50 counties in Minshan in the north, Xianling in the west, as well as in the Qionglai Shan in the centre, and the Liang Shan in the south.<br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor whitei</em><br/>In Tibet, China, this subspecies is known to occur south of the Yarlung Zangbo river, from Gyaca, Nangxian. Mainling, Myingchi, Cona and Lhunze, on the southern flank of the eastern Himalaya, to the west side of the big bend of the Yarlung Zangbo river. In Bhutan, no censuses have been carried out, but it is believed the species occurs in scattered populations throughout the forested and unforested mountain slopes along Bhutan’s northern border. One or two populations are known to occur on both sides of the upper catchment of the Mo Chu (Wollenhaupt, 1990). Within Bhutan, Jigme Dorji National Park is the main stronghold, but they are also found in northern Wangdue and Bumthang districts (Tshewang Wangchuk pers. comm., 2008); these populations appear to be separated from those in Tibet. Within India, takin is found in Arunachal Pradesh (both along its western border with Bhutan and its northeastern border with China and Myanmar), and in Sikkim. There it inhabits sub-tropical to subalpine forests, mainly between 2,000 and 3,500 m, but sometimes entering as low as 1,500 m, or up to areas above timberline (Fox and Johnsingh 1997, Singh 2002).",,Terrestrial,"In China, all subspecies are protected from direct exploitation by their inclusion under Category I of the  National Wildlife Law of 1988, although a small number are taken yearly in trophy hunts.

As of 2003, fourteen nature reserves, occupying about 3,250 km² have been established for protection of takin and their habitat. Logging bans established in the late 1990s greatly improved the habitat conditions and security for <em>B. t. bedfordi</em>.  <br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor taxicolor</em><br/>In the remote areas where this subspecies lives in China, local people may not be aware of its legal status. It occurs in Nujiang Nature Reserve, located in the northern mountains of Yunnan, which was established in 1981 to protect this takin along with other endangered species. Herds of greater than 100 animals have been seen in this nature reserve (Lu, 1987). It also occurs in Gaoligongshan in Yunnan. It ocurrs in Cibagou Nature Reserve (Wu and Zhang 2006) and Dong Jiu Nature Reserve (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 1996) in Tibet. It occurs mainly within protected areas in Myanmar, (Than Zaw pers comm. 2006). In Arunachel Pradesh, India, it occurs in Namdapha National Park, Mouling National Park, Dibang Willdife Sanctuary, Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve (Singh 2002). Conservation measures proposed are: 1) complete a population census of the Mishmi takin, beginning in the Nujiang Nature Reserve, before moving to other parts of its range; 2) develop a co-operative program between Chinese and Myanmar authorities to strictly forbid hunting of this animal; and 3) locate potential protected areas. <br/><br/><em>Budorcas taxicolor tibetana</em><br/>Between 1963 and 1978, a total of 10 nature reserves were established in Sichuan to protect endangered animals such as the giant panda and golden monkey, but most also provided protection for Sichuan takin.

The extent of occurrence of this species has been estimated as less than 20,000 km² (approximately 12,000 km²) between the northernmost and southernmost areas of occupancy.  Area of occupancy is estimated to be less than 2,000 km². The habitat where the species occurs is severely fragmented and degraded due to road widening, cutting of trees, bund maintenance, soil erosion and other kinds of human interference. In protected areas, the situation is better. It is assumed that the area of habitat has decreased over the years. There is evidence of trade in this species as seen on internet sites of traders advertising and hobbyists exchanging notes. Although the volume of trade is not known, this along with decreasing habitat quality and area of occupancy make the species Vulnerable.","This ground spider is primarily found in moist deciduous and evergreen forests. In observing a closely related species, <em>Thrigmopoeus truculentus</em>, we understand that the species occurs very patchily, with burrows on soil bunds with adequate vegetation cover. Burrows occasionally occur on flat ground. In examining the burrow aggregations, we have found the composition to have one adult female with several juveniles and subadults from different clutches in individual burrows close to the adult female’s burrow. Observation of population dynamics indicates a very high mortality rate in juveniles/subadults, of more than 95 percent in the first two years. Dispersal rates are unknown. Healthy populations of spiders/burrows are usually found in areas with very little disturbance.","Habitat loss and degradation are major threats. Road widening is most common threat for these ground theraphosid spiders (S. Molur &amp; M. Siliwal pers. obs.).  Many spiders get killed and their burrows get destroyed during this process.  Mud bund maintenance in forested areas along with man made fires and soil erosion are other threats. In more open areas, soil extraction and erosion are the reasons for disappearance of these spiders. An additional threat to the species is collection for the international pet trade market. Although the volume of trade is unknown, we have reports of some locals being involved and paid by European traders to collect and supply either personally, or through courier services.

Although rates in the eastern parts&#160;of its range, notably Viet Nam and Lao PDR, on average probably exceed 50% per 15 years (three generations), in large parts of the west and centre they may not even reach rates appropriate for Near Threatened listing (20-25%). Thus, Vulnerable is a global average. There is no reason to expect the decline rates to slow down; in particular, in Myanmar and Cambodia they may be increasing, fuelled by rising affluence and market connectivity. The situation in Cambodia is particularly likely to worsen, with increasing snaring in the eastern provinces that border Viet Nam, a known demand for traditional medicine that might be widespread in rural areas, and ongoing massive clearance of natural habitat for&#160;agro-industrial concessions.&#160;This species should be periodically reassessed for the Red List in light of ongoing threats and uncertainty about range-wide levels of exploitation and the effects these are having on wild populations. The change from the recent Near Threatened listing of <em>Arctonyx collaris&#160;</em>(<em>sensu lato</em>) reflects the taxonomic revision, excluding the populations of Sumatra (where ongoing declines are likely to be negligible) and most of China (where declines are also likely to be lower than average for Greater Hog Badger).","Greater Hog Badger is active throughout the day and night (despite past statements that the genus is nocturnal), ground-dwelling, and not very wary of people (e.g., Pocock 1941, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Helgen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Johnson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Holden and Neang 2009, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Gray <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014b).<br/><br/>Greater Hog Badger occurs down to the extreme lowlands (e.g. Bottom-Soaker National Park, Cambodia, and Kaziranga NP, Assam, India; Royan 2010,&#160;Choudhury 2013) up into the montane zone. The genus has been found up to 3,500 m, but Helgen <em>et al</em>. (2008) traced no record of this species above the relatively modest altitude of 1,500 m. Similarly, and based largely on different sets of records, the highest-altitude records traced for various countries are, Vietnam, 950 m (Roberton 2007); Cambodia, 1,200 m (Holden and Neang 2009); Myanmar, 1,500 m (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008); and Thailand, 1,016 m (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) . However, as cautioned by&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008), relevant survey effort above 1,500 m has been relatively limited in Myanmar and this is generally true throughout this species's range. Thus, the typical upper altitudinal limit may be found to be somewhat, even considerably, higher, as supported by records in Lao PDR up to nearly 2,300 m (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Choudhury (2013) recorded the genus up to 2,000 m in India, but suggested that the higher-altitude records would be of <em>A. albogularis</em>.<br/><br/>This species occurs across a wide variety of habitats, from heavy forest (both deciduous and evergreen) to the non-forested 'countryside' in at least North-east India; this includes grassland-dominated floodplains such as Kaziranga NP in Assam (Choudhury 2013), where it is one of the most frequently camera-trapped small carnivores (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). There are also records in Bangladesh (assumed to be this species) from tea-gardens and other non-forest habitats (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). In South-east Asia most records come from forests. The extent of actual and potential occupation of non-forest habitats is unknown: concerted survey in them is rare and off-take of mammals of this size is heavy in much of this species's range. Thus, it is possible&#160;that they would occur widely in non-forest parts of&#160;South-east Asia but are currently excluded by hunting levels.<br/><br/>The diet is poorly known, but Helgen <em>et al</em>. (2008) speculated that it might be partly to strongly vermivorous. This was based on morphological attributes more than on direct dietary information. A strong dependence on worms would neatly explain the pattern of current habitat use in Lao PDR (see 'population') - widespread and still locally common in montane areas but nearly or effectively extirpated from the plains. The country's plains have a harsh dry season, when the ground even within semi-evergreen forest (true evergreen forest is highly localised in the country's lowlands) bakes hard. Finding large numbers of worms under such conditions is presumably difficult and highly demanding of energy. By contrast, in the mountains, forest soil remains damper through the dry season, as a result of cooler temperatures, the sometimes frequent mists and cloud, and the fuller shading of true evergreen forest. Thus, in regions with a harsh dry season, it is reasonable to suppose higher population densities in hills and mountains than in plains and low hills, and a higher resilience to hunting. Such seasonality occurs almost across the species's range excepting most of Vietnam, the Thai-Malay peninsula and locally around massifs large enough to generate their own precipitation. Nonetheless, the species does occur in plains regions of Cambodia and Thailand with dry seasons as or more harsh than in Lao PDR; these areas have&#160;somewhat to much lower hunting pressure.","The heterogeneous pattern of Greater Hog Badger detections and the variation in encounter rates, with the lowest rates in the very heavily hunted countries of Viet Nam and Lao PDR, strongly suggest that the species is in hunting-driven decline. Based on Lao PDR, extirpation, or decline to densities making detections extremely unlikely, seems to have proceeded faster in areas with marked dry seasons than in mountain evergreen forests with a more benign dry season, presumably because starting populations were higher in the latter habitats than in the former (see 'Habitats and ecology'). In Viet Nam, trade-driven hunting rose to industrial levels&#160;a decade or so earlier than in Lao PDR. The low number of camera-trap survey areas in Viet Nam with records of the species indicate that even in the presumed optimal habitats of evergreen forest with only a mild dry season, steep declines and, presumably, extirpation can occur. To date, hunting is at much lower levels in the rest of this species's range. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, much hunting involves metal cable snares set in long lines linked by drift fences, an approach very effective in catching ground-dwelling animals (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014); these snares are, mostly, big enough to secure Greater Hog Badger, because large ungulates are amongst the main targets. The geographical use of such snaring has expanded rapidly over the last 20 years and evidently continues to do so. In much of the species's range, most people entering forest and other natural habitat for whatever reason are accompanied by dogs, many have firearms, and most secure opportunistically any animal of hog badger size-class that they come across. Being partly diurnal, ground-dwelling and not prone to shyness, hog badgers must be particularly at risk to such opportunistic off-take.<br/><br/>The threat which habitat change poses directly to this species is not clear. Indirectly, anything that opens up access to areas previously difficult to enter, in particular which allows vehicular removal of wildlife for sale, exacerbates the hunting threat. Almost all forms of habitat change by people co-occur with increased human access and presence, making the indirect threat from habitat change severe. Based on localities of specific records, it is unlikely that degraded and fragmented natural habitat are inherently unsuitable. These are not widely occupied probably because their higher densities of people, with concomitantly increased likelihood for badgers of lethal incidental encounters with people, prevent this. Outright conversion to entirely artificial habitat (agriculture, settlement and infrastructure) seems more likely to render an area unsuitable for Greater Hog Badger, but even this remains to be proven. Overall, the existence of large tracts of forest in the eastern parts of the species's range with at best low densities of this species indicate that there the chief threat is hunting. While perhaps this is not yet so in parts of the western range, it is increasingly likely to become so there, too.<br/><br/>In Kaziranga National Park, India, numbers die in the periodic inundation of this flood-plain (Choudhury 2013). While formerly such animals might have been able to move safely to higher ground, the increasing fragmentation of natural habitat probably leads to higher mortalities nowadays. Nonetheless, in total these are likely to be insignificant to overall decline rates of the species, and are only a potential threat at the most local of levels.<br/><br/>Hog badger hairs are used in European shaving brush manufacture (Domingo-Roura <em>et al</em>. 2006) but whether this species and wild populations are involved is unclear; the large farmed stock in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) seems a more likely origin.","Greater Hog Badger populations have not been studied in sufficient detail for densities or trends to be known in any part of the range. Camera-trap encounter rates vary widely across its range: in some it is among the most commonly and widely photographed small carnivores, such as in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Nakai–Nam Theun National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), in others it is only rarely found if at all (e.g., modern Viet Nam: Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3).<br/><br/>At least two factors might produce this heterogeneous recording pattern: (i) natural variation in densities and (ii) human-induced declines proceeding at different rates across the range.&#160;Both are probably important. Past information is rarely precise enough to assess even the coarse population trend directly. However, judging by patterns in better documented hunting-sensitive groups of ground-dwelling mammals (e.g., wild cattle <em>Bo</em><em>s</em>, Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em>, Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>), it would be reasonable to expect human pressure to have depressed densities in Lao PDR and Viet Nam more than in Thailand and Cambodia. And this indeed seems to have happened. Recent camera-trapping has recorded the species in only very few areas in Viet Nam (Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3, Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014); Roberton (2007) had already drawn attention to the surprising paucity of records in the country in the 1990s and early 2000s. In Lao PDR, by contrast, all published large-scale camera-trap surveys have found the species (Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA,&#160;Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009; Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014; Xe Sap NPA, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b), indicating a healthier status than in Vietnam (as is typical for hunting-sensitive species). The three camera-trap survey areas are likely to hold amongst the least-depleted large mammal faunas in Lao PDR. All are in rugged mountainous areas and indeed all post-1990 Lao records of Hog Badger come from hill and montane areas; there has been none from the plains. This pattern, making due allowance for the distribution of survey effort, was already apparent in the pre-camera-trapping era by 1999, based on direct sightings and records of dead animals or their parts (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). By contrast, this species is commonly recorded at low altitudes, including in plains landscapes, of Thailand and Cambodia (Royan 2010, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a,&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014) and it is common in similar lowland terrain in Kaziranga NP, Assam (Choudhury 2013). This suggests strongly that the absence of recent Lao records from such terrain (where hunting is more efficient than in rugged terrain, meaning that hunting-sensitive species across a range of vertebrate taxa tend to have declined faster there) reflects steep declines (and plausibly widespread extirpation) there.<br/><br/>The occurrence in Myanmar is also patchy without obvious natural explanation (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008); thus far, the pattern of records has not been&#160;compared closely with those of species known to be sensitive to hunting.&#160;In&#160;Cambodia, while it has been recorded relatively commonly in some areas such as parts of the north-east (Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a), in the 'northern plains', west of the Mekong, it was not recorded in 6,000 camera-trap nights of survey in the 2012-2013 and 2013–2014 dry seasons, and the most recent record there seems to have been in 2001 (D. H. A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). Thus area abuts Lao PDR and this apparent range retreat corroborates the suggestion that it has been hunted out from such habitat in Lao PDR.&#160;In Thailand, it seems to remain generally common with no large landscapes of (semi-) natural habitat lacking records (when patterns in survey effort are allowed for) (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In North-east India the genus, although widespread, is generally not common (Choudhury 2013). The population status in its Chinese range (part of Yunnan province) seems poorly known, even at the level of genus.",Decreasing,"Greater Hog Badger occurs from Bangladesh and North-east India east through Myanmar, Thailand and Lao PDR to Vietnam and south to Cambodia and peninsula Thailand; it probably also inhabits Yunnan province, China. Inconclusive reports from the state of Perak, northernmost peninsular Malaysia, have never been confirmed (Helgen<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2008).<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<br/><br/>The range in Bangladesh and North-east India is provisional.&#160;Because&#160;Helgen <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008)&#160;traced only a few hog badger records from this area&#160;that could be assigned to species, both mainland hog badger species might occur in this area:&#160;so&#160;the many recent records simply&#160;identified as 'hog badger' should not, at this&#160;stage,&#160;be identified to&#160;species&#160;on any presumption of range or habitat. In&#160;North-east India the genus is well distributed all over, with most records taken to be this species including animals observed in Manas NP, north(west) of the Brahmaputra (Choudhury 2013). This contests the proposal of Helgen&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008) that said drainage forms the species's (north)west range boundary.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, the genus occurs widely, with records from&#160;the South-east (Chittagong and Cox's Bazar district and Chittagong Hill Tracts), Dudhpukuria-Dhopacharia Wildlife Sanctuary (Feeroz <em>et al</em>. 2012), Chunoti&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary, Fasiakhali&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary, Chittagong University campus (outside the city and middle of hills), and from the North-east (Sylhet division; Moulovibazar and Habigonj districts), adjacent to Lawachara National Park (all records per Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014).&#160;These records are likely all to relate to this species, although objective confirmation is desirable.<br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/>Almost all hog badger specimens examined by&#160;Helgen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008) from China were judged to be <em>A. albogularis</em>, but two specimens from Lichiang, Yunnan, were ""provisionally"" assigned to Greater Hog Badger.<br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/>Than Zaw <em>et al</em>.

In Lao PDR, the palatability of this hog badger varies between ethnic groups, with some groups disliking the taste, whereas groups in parts of the Nam Theun basin (and presumably elsewhere) esteem the species as food (J.P. Baker pers. comm. to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, J. Chamberlain per. comm. to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). The genus, presumably including this species, is also eaten by some groups in India (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006), and is hunted as well as farmed for food in China (M.W.N. Lao pers. comm. 2006). Across most of its range, most of the catch is probably not targeted, but is by non-selective methods for wildlife meat, or opportunistically during activities other than hunting.",Terrestrial,"Throughout its range, Greater Hog Badger is found in a number of protected areas, perhaps particularly in Myanmar, India and Thailand (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2008, Choudhury 2013, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). This species is protected by law in Thailand (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014), in Bangladesh (as a Schedule 1 species) under the Wildlife Act 2012 (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014), and in India, under the highest level of protection (Choudhury 2013). This species is not protected in Viet Nam or Cambodia and is the largest-bodied unprotected mammal, except for Eurasian Wild Hog <em>Sus scrofa</em>, in Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008).

Habitat loss over this period has been the predominant driver of decline in the southern (Sundaic) portion of the range, where a significant proportion of lowland habitats have been converted to other land-uses that do not support the species e.g. oil palm plantations. In the northern portion of the range the rampant hunting and trade of mammals in this size-class (within northern South-east Asia and up into China; e.g. Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004), within which Binturong is a significant part, has severely depressed populations even within remaining large blocks of little-degraded forest (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014; Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2014b; Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3). Populations in the northern range continue to be threatened by wildlife hunting and by the recent proliferation of agro-industries and other forms of forest conversion in the region, which are causing habitat loss in some protected areas that potentially still hold the species. Thus the species is considered to be experiencing population declines sufficient to meet the threshold for Vulnerable in this northern part of its range on the basis of actual or potential levels of exploitation, with habitat loss being an additional factor (e.g. WWF 2013). In the Sundaic portion of the range, habitat loss has been severe in the lowlands (e.g.&#160;Holmes 2000;&#160;BirdLife International 2001; Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2001; McMorrow and Talip 2001; Lambert and Collar 2002; Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004; Fuller 2004;&#160;Sodhi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010;&#160;Eames <em>et al</em>. 2005, Aratrakorn <em>et al</em>. 2006; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014; Stibig&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This forest loss, particularly in the lowlands, is predicted to continue within the next three generations within parts of the species’s range (e.g. Borneo). However, in other parts, much lowland forest has already gone, and future forest loss, proportionate to what remains, is likely to slow down in some areas. Because there is no evidence that Binturong uses the plantations that,&#160;largely,&#160;are replacing natural forest in this region (e.g. Semiadi <em>et al</em>. in prep.), major declines can be inferred based on decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality. There is insufficient information about Binturong usage of high-altitude forests (where forest is being lost more slowly), however, it is certainly not primarily a montane species and lowland forest habitats are thought to be the most suitable, and on this basis the populations in the Sundaic portion of the range are also judged to be declining at rates sufficient to warrant listing as Vulnerable, mainly through habitat loss compounded with killing and capture.","Binturong is primarily arboreal, but does descend to the ground; in fact the number of camera-trap photographs of this species across its range reveals a level of ground activity higher than had previously been unexpected for this species. Also, the species has been caught in baited live traps set on the ground (Grassman <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is heavy and ponderous (adults can reach over 20 kg), and where more agile arboreal animal species could leap between trees, it must descend to the ground to go from one tree to another (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The ecology of this species is poorly known and might vary between areas; information about diel activity is&#160;conflicting. Grassman <em>et al</em>. (2005) noted it to be crepuscular and nocturnal, &#160;and targeted small carnivore surveys at a logging concession in Sarawak, Borneo (Malaysia), recorded the species only during the early morning and during the night (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010). By contrast,&#160;Nettelbeck (1997) found it often to be active during the day, and many other day-time field sightings have been made incidentally during forest research (e.g. Lambert 1990, Datta 1999, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sayam Chowdhury pers. comm. 2015). Activity patterns have also been described as cathemeral (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>In&#160;Phu Kieo Wildlife Sanctuary,&#160;Thailand, Grassman <em>et al</em>. (2005) found that males have a mean annual range size of 6.2 km² with a mean overlap of 35%. A single female Binturong tracked in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary had a home range of 6.9 km² (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2015). The species is thought to be predominantly frugivorous. There is a detailed observation of a group of Binturongs feeding on figs <em>Ficus&#160;</em>over several nights in North-east India (Murali <em>et al</em>. 2013), and many of the incidental observations of the species are of animals in fruiting trees (e.g. Lambert 1990, Nettelbeck 1997, Datta 1999, Low 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, recent records are from extensive evergreen forest, (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In the Philippines, the species is found in primary and secondary lowland forest, including grassland-forest mosaic from sea level to 400 m (Rabor 1986, Esselstyn <em>et al</em>. 2004). It was recorded in secondary forest, that had been logged in the 1970s, and which surrounds a palm estate, in Malaysia in 2000–2001 by Azlan (2003). Mathai <em>et al</em>. (2010) recorded the species in a logging concession, although never amid active logging; all records were from patches of forest with medium to high relative levels of contiguity. In Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, the Binturong was camera-trapped in all surveys of forest areas throughout the state, including primary and logged forest, but was not detected in oil palm plantations. &#160;In one survey it was detected at over 1,000 m a.s.l. (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald unpublished data). Elsewhere in Borneo it has been recorded down almost to sea-level (e.g. Sabangau National Park, Central Kalimantan; Semiadi et al. in prep.). Meijaard <em>et al</em>. (2008) classified the species as tolerant of moderate intensity logging, and it has been recorded from logged forest on Borneo (Samejima <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Bangladesh the few confirmed records are from hill evergreen forest in the north-east and south-east (Chakma 2015, Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015). In Java the species has been observed in a mosaic open forest landscape, interspersed with agriculture and non-native forest plantations, where, in the&#160;several years of&#160;survey,&#160;there was only a single record of hunting of nocturnal mammals (Rode-Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014); the species is never (or only exceptionally rarely) recorded in such landscapes in northern South-east Asia, which are invariably hunted heavily, perhaps explaining this difference. There are no records of this species from within blocks of monoculture plantations such as palm oil or rubber.<br/><br/>The litter size is typically one to three, with a gestation of about 92 days, reaching adult size in one year; individuals may live as long as 18 years (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Litter size in captivity is one to six, most commonly two. Observations in captivity have shown that copulation usually takes place in trees.","Habitat loss and degradation are major threats to the Binturong (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989) as is fragmentation, particularly in those parts of the range where hunting is heavy. Throughout this species's range, there has been loss and degradation of forests through logging and conversion of forests to non-forest land-uses (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2010; WWF 2013, 2015; Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014). Forest conversion has been extremely high in the lower-altitude parts of its Sundaic range in the last 20 years (e.g. Holmes 2000,&#160;BirdLife International 2001,&#160;Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Kinnaird <em>et al</em>. 2003, Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames <em>et al</em>. 2005, Aratrakorn <em>et al</em>. 2006, Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014, Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014, Stibig <em>et al</em>. 2014). Protected areas are not exempt from deforestation; 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000–2012 was lost in areas where logging is restricted (national parks and protected forests; Rode-Margano <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in Kalimantan specifically, 56% of protected lowland forests were cleared from 1985 to 2001 (Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004). Lowland deforestation&#160;is now also a growing threat to populations in mainland South-east Asia (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Donald <em>et al</em>. 2015). Choudhury (1997) noted that large-scale deforestation in Indian portions of the species’s range could be contributing to its increased rarity, because many former records come from areas where forests are now being degraded. In China, rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether (Pu <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Throughout South-east Asia, Binturong is hunted for its meat, for traditional medicines and as pets (Corlett 2007, Roberton 2007, Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008, Shepherd 2008, Shepherd and Shepherd 2010, Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Philippines, this species is harvested for the pet trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption (GMA Philippines 2006). In Lao PDR, this species is among the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane (R.J. Tizard pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2015). Considered a delicacy in parts of Lao PDR, the Binturong is taken for food and is also traded as a food item to Viet Nam (I. Johnson pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). There is a large demand for civet meat, including Binturong, in China and Viet Nam (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004, Roberton 2007).<br/><br/>Recent camera-trapping evidence across the species’s range has made clear that the Binturong descends to the ground more frequently than had previously been thought; therefore, the threat of snaring to this species is likely to be more serious than had been assumed. Non-specific hunting of large mammals is very high across most of the species's mainland range, with industrial level cable-snaring especially prevalent in parts of northern South-east Asia. Given that the Binturong is relatively unafraid of people and is sometimes active during the day, it is often conspicuous both to surveyors (suggesting that the few encounters reflect a low population) and to hunters (thus exposing it to elevated risk) (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999); this is supported by verbal reports from wildlife hunters in North-east India (see Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). A number of national-, landscape- and survey-area-level reviews of small carnivore records in mainland South-east Asia have found Binturong to be infrequently recorded, and sometimes not at all, in relatively intensive camera-trap surveys (i.e. more than 1,000 effective camera-trap-nights) (e.g. Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014; Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2014b; Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3). Although the species’s arboreality may in part explain the paucity of records, the large number of camera-trap&#160;surveys, some of which were targeted at species found in similar habitats e.g. Mainland Clouded Leopard <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>, and the hunting-pressures in this region that have caused the declines in a large range of animal species, suggests that the current infrequency of Binturong records from the mainland South-east Asia portion of its range may be a genuine indication of its rarity there and that this reflects recent decline.","Historically, the Binturong was often thought to be relatively common within its distribution range, but it is now mostly uncommon or rare, and is likely to be approaching national extinction in some range countries in mainland South-east Asia (including Viet Nam) and in China. Lekagul and McNeely (1977) stated that it was rare in Thailand, although Nettelbeck (1997) observed it frequently in a small and intensively watched part of Khao Yai National Park. In Lao PDR, there were only three sightings in the extensive wildlife surveys into some of the remotest parts of the country between 1992 and 1999 (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although the species is mostly arboreal, it is detectable using camera-traps, and relatively intensive post-1999 field surveys that have used this method in suitable habitat in protected areas have produced few or no records of this species in Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em> 2009, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a) and Viet Nam (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: SOM T3), indicating apparently severe declines in these countries. There are very few camera-trap records from Cambodia, although live animals are relatively frequently confiscated from the wildlife trade there (N. Marx per J. Holden pers. comm. 2015). Thailand might be expected to hold one of the healthiest populations in mainland South-east Asia, but declines are suspected there as well (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Myanmar, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) confirmed camera-trap records from six survey areas (from Kachin state in the north to Tenasserim in the south), and the species has since been detected in most of the few recent (post-2013) camera-trap surveys in the country, with records from Karen state, Tanintharyi division, and from Tamanthi Wildlife Reserve in Sagaing division (WCS, NWCD, KWCI unpublished data per T.N.E. Gray 2015), suggesting that it might rival Thailand as a core country for the species’s conservation in mainland South-east Asia. There are very few records from Bangladesh, but a camera-trap photograph of an adult with young from the Chittagong Hill Tracts (Chakma 2015), suggests that there is a breeding population at least at this site. In North-east India, it is becoming rarer because of habitat loss, because it seems to prefer mature forest, and is mostly restricted to protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Medhalya, Nagaland, Tirupura and Sikkim (Choudhury 2013). It is approaching national extinction in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Binturong was detected by camera-traps in forest surveys across Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, including logged areas, but where logging activities were recent, detections were fewer than in both adjacent primary forest and older logged forest, suggesting a decline in population in logged areas, at least initially (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald, unpublished data). In Sumatra (Indonesia), the species is probably still widespread in the remaining lowlands in Aceh province and upland forests throughout Sumatra; it is relatively frequently observed and camera-trapped in the Batang Toru forest in North Sumatra, up to 1,000 m a.s.l. (G. Fredriksson unpublished data 2015). Binturong is thought to be relatively common in Kerinci, West Sumatra (Holden 2006, J. Holden pers. comm. 2015). The bones of a Binturong were collected from a snare-trap set for Serow <em>Capricornis&#160;sumatrensis</em>&#160;at 2,500 m a.s.l. in Kerinci, West Sumatra (Holden 2006).&#160;In the Philippines, the species is localized and uncommon (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998): populations are thought to be decreasing as a result of collection for the pet trade.",Decreasing,"The Binturong is widespread in South and South-east Asia occurring from eastern Nepal, Bangladesh, north-east India and southern China through mainland and island South-east Asia, south-east to Java (Indonesia) and occurring also on the Philippine islands of&#160;Calauit and Palawan (Corbet and Hill 1992, Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998, Choudhury 2013). In North-east India it is known from all the states, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, West Bengal (northern parts), Sikkim and Tripura, being widespread in several of them (Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species has been camera-trapped in Royal Manas National Park, Bhutan (Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2011), and is predicted to be present in other southern parts of Bhutan, where suitable habitat remains largely intact (A. U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2015). In Bangladesh there are confirmed sightings from the north-east (Tania Khan per Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015), the Chittagong Hill Tracts were it has been camera-trapped (Chakma 2015), and in Cox’s Bazar district, south-east Bangladesh, where an animal was photographed (Sayam Chowdhury per Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2015). Eastern Nepal represents the known western limit of the species’s geographic range, although no recent confirmed records could be traced (Sanjan Thapa pers. comm. 2015, Yadav Ghimirey pers. comm. 2015); but recent suitable survey in this part of the country has been very limited and the species is considered likely&#160;to persist there. It occurred, at least formerly, in Guangxi and Yunnan provinces of southern China, but there are few recent records, none outside Yunnan (Wang 2003, Lau<em> et al</em>. 2010, C. Huang pers. comm. 2015). It potentially occurred historically in Singapore although there are no known records from the country (Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no confirmed records from Brunei, but this is likely to be because of poor survey effort and not because of any ecological factors (Semiadi <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/><br/>It occurs from sea level up to 3,000 m a.s.l., although it is thought to live at higher densities in lowland forest habitats (i.e. below 1,000 m) (see the Habitats and Ecology section, below)","In the Philippines this species is caught for the pet trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption (GMA Philippines 2006). In Lao PDR, this species is one of most frequently displayed caged live carnivores (e.g. five displayed in Pakxe market place during 2013; T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2015). In addition, skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane (R. Tizard pers. comm. to Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Many of the animals traded are young (I. Johnson pers. comm.&#160;to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). Considered a delicacy in parts of Lao PDR, the Binturong is taken for food and is also traded as a food item to Viet Nam (I. Johnson pers. comm.&#160;to Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). In Viet Nam, there are a few recent records of this species kept as pets or display animals in hotels (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2015), and the species is also traded for Viet Nam’s wildlife meat and traditional medicine markets, for which a wide range of animal species are hunted (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). Binturong meat is valued locally in Arunachal Pradesh, North-east India (Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008; Naniwadekar <em>et al</em>. 2013). Civets (Viverridae), including Binturongs, are traded their meat for across Peninsular Malaysia (Shepherd and Shepherd 2010). In Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and the hill districts of Assam in India, it is hunted opportunistically and its meat is taken for subsistence use&#160;(A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2015). In Indonesia, when ‘kopi luwak’ ('civet coffee') became a popular product among coffee makers and consumers, several local ‘luwak farmers’ in Lampung, Sumatra, were observed using captive Binturongs and Common Palm Civets <em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</em> to produce this coffee (G. Semiadi and Wirdateti unpublished data 2014). In early 2013 when the ‘civet lovers’ hobby in Indonesia emerged, Binturongs were traded, although the number of this species in collections is thought to be low. Several Binturongs were seen for sale for the exotic pet trade in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, in 2014 (G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2015).",Terrestrial,"Stricter enforcement of legislation against poaching, wildlife trade, habitat degradation and deforestation is required to conserve Binturong. In India it has been on CITES Appendix III since 1989 (CITES 2015). It has also been listed under Schedule I of The Wild Life (Protection) Act of India; this gives the highest conservation status to any species. In Borneo, it is included on Schedule 2 of Sabah’s Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997, under which hunting and collection is allowed with appropriate license issued by the Sabah Wildlife Department, on Part II of the First Schedule of the Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998, and on Indonesia’s Government Regulation No 7. In Brunei, however, the Binturong is not legally protected. In Bangladesh it has complete protection under wildlife protection law of 2012. It is protected in Malaysia, Thailand (under WARPA 2003), and in Viet Nam (Appendix 1B; Decree 32/2006). In the Philippines, the Environmental Legal Assistance Center has been involved in controlling and enforcing wildlife laws. The&#160;species&#160;is listed as Critically Endangered on the China Red List.<br/><br/>Binturong occurs in many protected areas spread across its current range; however, the effectiveness of these reserves at protecting this species is highly variable: it has not been targeted as a conservation focus, or indeed even surveyed for, in many protected areas, and most of the confirmed records are from general surveys or by-catch from surveys aimed at other species. Detailed radio-tracking studies, combined with watching to pay particular attention to ground-level use, would aid,&#160;greatly, understanding of this species’s ecology and therefore (i) a far more confident assessment of whether the lack of camera-trap records from some areas is a genuine reflection of decline/absence, and not of ineffective camera-trap placement, and (ii) more effectively targeted conservation.",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global
2175,46363646,2891,Bos gaurus,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2016-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Gaur qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion A (VU A2cd+3cd+4cd). The population&#160;decline in parts of its range especially Indochina and Malaysia,&#160;perhaps also Myanmar and China, is likely to be well over 70% over the last&#160;three generations (generation length estimated at 8-10 years), whereas in India&#160;and Nepal the overall decline rate is considerably lower. This reflects that in&#160;the various reasonably well-protected areas, and a small number of animals in some non-protected areas where they are protected for cultural reasons, population trends are stable, and in a few areas which have been neglected but are the focus of improved&#160;protection, populations are rebuilding. Karanth <em>et al.</em> (2010) estimated average local extinction rates of Gaur distribution at 60% over past 50 years in India with the rates varying from 7% from reasonably protected habitats to a high of 98% from unprotected habitats. The global distribution of the Gaur has reduced by over 80% in past 100 years and Gaur is now mostly limited to habitats within protected areas (Groves and Grubb 2011). Weighting these by population size gives&#160;an overall decline of at least 30% over the last three generations. Similar&#160;reductions are projected, largely because the causative factors (especially wild&#160;meat hunting and hunting for the trade in horns in Southeast Asia, habitat loss and hunting for meat in South Asia) are still&#160;operative. Although the proportion of the global population which is in&#160;relatively well protected habitats in India is increasing, and thus the averaged global&#160;decline rate ought to decrease, an ongoing decline of 30% (in the next three generations) or more is adjudged likely. The recent history in Malaysia proves&#160;that directed Gaur poaching can induce rapid declines in regions previously&#160;judged relatively safe. Poaching in Malaysia is undertaken by international&#160;gangs and it is likely that once returns in Malaysia drop they will move to&#160;other countries, though there is no evidence for this yet; the patterns in other high-value species in more advanced&#160;declines (e.g. southeast Asian otters) indicate that incursion even to southern&#160;India is likely. The species could potentially qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C, although there are not enough quantitative data available.","The Gaur occurs from sea level up to at least 2,800 m asl (Wood 1937, Wharton 1968, Choudhury 2002). Despite the many reports that call it an animal of hill-country, low-lying areas seem to comprise optimal habitat (Choudhury 2002): in Conry’s (1989) study area, elevations ranged from 46 to 1,079 m asl but the three radio-tracked Gaur only used areas below 381 m. Elevations below 61 m were used most intensively and all three animals selected these low-lying areas; elevations above 61 m were selected against or used in proportion to availability (Conry 1989). Similarly, in the Tenasserim-Dawna mountains, Thailand, signs of Gaur were more abundant in the lowlands than in the hills, noting that this was the opposite of the patterns that would be predicted if hunting (itself concentrated heavily in the lowlands) was the chief determinant of population densities, although solitary animals were found mainly in the hills (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008). Schaller (1967) compared vegetation maps of India with the (mid-20th century) distribution of Gaur and concluded that the species was largely confined to evergreen, semi-evergreen, and moist deciduous forest but it also occurred in dry deciduous forest areas at the periphery of its range. He considered Gaur habitat to be ""characterized by (1) large, relatively undisturbed forest tracts, (2) hilly terrain below an altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 ft (1,500-1,800 m asl), (3) availability of water, and (4) an abundance of forage in the form of coarse grasses (including bamboo), shrubs, and trees"". However, He cautioned that the apparent preference of Gaur for hilly terrain may be partly due to the earlier conversion of most of the plains and other low lying areas to croplands and pastures. Kumar (2010) investigated factors influencing spatial distribution of Gaur abundance in Nagarahole-Bandipur reserves and observed that the Gaur abundance patterns were primarily determined by protection effectiveness, local levels of human disturbance and undulating terrain. He also observed that these ecological and anthropogenic factors induced variation in local abundance from less than 1 per km² to about 50 animals per km² (Kumar 2010). Similarly, Wharton (1968) concluded that Gaur appeared to avoid evergreen rainforest, ""preferring foothill tracts of sub-humid or deciduous forest adjacent to savannah forest, glades or other open terrain affected by man and fire thus co-existing with and exploiting low human populations in hill zones with moderate to heavy rainfall"". Throughout the range of Gaur, habitat destruction and human presence is usually higher in lowlands than in hills, meaning that differential human pressures may have caused the apparent preference of Gaur for hills. Gaur occurs in many forest types in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia including truly evergreen and montane forest, but populations in closed canopy forests especially those at higher elevations might naturally be at much lower densities than those in lowland areas with a mosaic of open and closed forest types, and in closed canopy forests areas the species appears to frequent grassy openings (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Greiser Johns 2000, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although no significant difference was found in overall Gaur densities in moist compared with dry deciduous forests in Nagarahole, India (Karanth and Sunquist 1992), local variation in Gaur densities ranged between less than 1 per km² to more than 45 per km² in Nagarahole and Bandipur reserves due to variation in local habitat factors conducive for Gaurs (Kumar 2010). Steinmetz et al. (in prep.) considered that Gaur herds in an expanding population were consistently concentrated in mixed deciduous forest rather than semi-evergreen forest, although the total area of study, that was safe from poaching, was only 20 km². <br/><br/>Gaur can persist in fragmented areas with some habitat disturbance and hunting, including in landscapes dominated by plantations (such as on parts of the Valparai plateau, south India), but in Southeast Asia it has been too heavily hunted in such areas to survive in them. Gaur can better tolerate rugged terrain and denser forest than other wild and domestic cattle, provided that there are adequate water sources (Kumar 2010, Smith and Xie Yan 2008). In Thailand it uses former cultivation amid forest, and populations in such areas can recover well if not hunted (Anak Pattanavipool pers. comm. 2006, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Gaur only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the Sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Gaur both grazes and browses, reportedly eating mostly young green grasses but also leaves, fruit, twigs, and bark of various woody species, as well as coarse dry grasses, and bamboo. It seems able to maintain good condition on relatively low quality feed. At least 180-190 species of plants have been recorded in the diet (Kumar 2010). More information is given about Gaur’s diet in Dunbar Brander (1923), Hubback (1937), Schaller (1967), Wharton (1968), Krishnan (1972), Khan (1973), Conry (1981), Ebil Yusof (1982), Ramachandran <em>et al</em>. (1986), Prayurasiddhi and Smith (1993) and Sankar <em>et </em>al. (2000). Captive Gaur are reported to eat about 20 kg of green fodder per day (Ramachandran et al. 1986). During the cool season (November-February) the Gaur that Schaller (1967) studied in central India ate various herbs, large quantities of the leaves and seeds of bamboo, various other grasses, and the leaves of a number of tree species; but by the beginning of the hot season (March-June) coarse dry and semi-dry grasses made up the bulk of their diet, averaging 85% by volume (range 66-100%; four rumen samples), with browse only making up about 10%. Gaur also feeds on crops including corn, cassava, and young rubber trees, sometimes causing great damage (Wharton 1968, National Research Council 1983). Schaller (1967) reported that Gaur in Kanha National Park drank at least once per day during the hot season, usually in the evening. The mean annual group size of re-introduced Gaur in Bhandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, was estimated at 7.3 ± 0.76 (SE). The overall estimated summer, monsoon and winter home ranges of gaur were 290 km², 137 km² and 155 km² (Minimum Convex Polygon) respectively. The overall individual male home ranges varied from 135 to 142 km2, and overall individual female home ranges varied from 32 to 169 km2. In summer, Gaur largely preferred grassland (P&lt;0.0001), whereas in monsoon and winter, Gaur preferred bamboo mixed forest (P&lt;0.0001). Gaur avoided open mixed forest (P&lt;0.0001) and agricultural land in all three seasons. In total, Gaur fed on 68 plant species (Sankar <em>et al </em>2013). Sahai (1972) stated that Gaur drink at least twice in a 24-hour period but there appears to be no fixed time for drinking. In undisturbed areas, Gaur is mainly diurnal, but in areas of high human disturbance, it is reported to become mainly nocturnal.<br/><br/>The basic social group appears to be a female-juvenile unit with larger groups tending to be more-or-less temporary assemblages (as in the other large species of Asian Bovini). Maternal herds containing several adult cows, juveniles, and calves frequently occur but their composition is somewhat fluid, particularly during the rut; these herds can often contain several subadult and adult males. The number of bulls in a herd changes with the time of year. Mature males associate with cows primarily during the rut: during Schaller’s study in Kanha National Park 65% of herds were accompanied by a mature male during April (the peak of the rut) but during the second half of the year the proportion dropped to 31% (Schaller 1967). Neither Schaller (1967) nor Sahai (1972) found any evidence to support Powell’s (1964) statement that young bulls usually live apart from the maternal herds; nor did Schaller’s observations support Dunbar Brander’s (1923) statement that the ’master bull’ drives all other males from the herd. Males not associating with mixed herds either live in all-male groups or are solitary. The bull herds are generally unstable, although sometimes two or more animals may frequently associate. The typical herd size appears to be in the range of 5-12 animals and herds are rarely larger than 20 (Dunbar Brander 1923, Hubback 1937, Hislop 1961a, Schaller 1967, Prater 1971, Sahai 1972, Pal and Guin 1986). Large groups of 20, 40, or even 100 animals are probably temporary aggregations of smaller groups (Pal and Guin 1986).<br/><br/>The majority of the 125-150 Gaur studied by Schaller (1967) in Kanha National Park (India) ranged over an area of at least 78 km²; and the herds he studied travelled on average 2-3 miles (3.2-4.8 km) a day, although on occasion the distance could be much less. In West Malaysia Gaur home ranges have been estimated to be: approximately 13 km² (the Kuala Tahan herd in Taman Negara National Park) (Weigum 1972); and 29.9 km² for a yearling male, 52.1 km² for a yearling female, and 137.3 km² for an adult male in Pahang (Conry 1989). The large differences between the two studies probably reflect the different methods employed by the two workers (see Conry 1989: 60). Home ranges that can be as large as 137 km² hinder the setting aside of conservation areas for Gaur, particularly as Gaur often occurs in those areas where the pressures for economic development are highest.<br/><br/>In central India, most Gaur mate in December and January, and calves are born in August and September according to Dunbar Brander (1923); Stebbing (1911) and Sanderson (1912) generally agreed with Dunbar Brander but noted that calves may also be born in April, May, and June. In Kanha National Park (central India) Schaller (1967) recorded rutting bulls from December to June, with an apparent peak of sexual behaviour in March and April; however, the occurrence of a few new-born animals throughout the year indicated that some mating must occur in every month. In southern India the majority of matings reportedly take place between November and March (Morris 1937). In Cambodia the majority of Gaur births occur in December and January (Wharton 1957). In Myanmar, calves are born throughout the year (Evans 1912, Peacock 1933); and in West Malaysia young Gaur are seen in all months except October to December (Hubback 1937).<br/><br/>The gestation period of Gaur is reported to be nine months by Hubback (1937) and Crandall (1964) and 270 days, ‘a little shorter than for Banteng or domestic cattle and longer than for yak and Kouprey’, by National Research Council (1983: 49). Only one calf is born to a cow per pregnancy; there are no records of twins (Hubback 1937, Schaller 1967). Females probably first mate when about two years old and thus have their first calf at three years old (Schaller 1967). If the food supply is favourable, most adult females probably calve every year. In Kanha National Park, approximately 90% of adult cows bore young during a year but calf mortality was high, with about 50% of the calves dying before reaching one year old; the main cause of death was predation by Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) (Schaller 1967).<br/><br/>Rarely, bulls kill each other when fighting, and occasionally they are severely injured while fighting. Predation is by far the major cause of Gaur mortality, perhaps followed by disease (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). For example in Bandipur, Gaur is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger (42%) and Leopard Panthera pardus (15%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur, Gaur remains were found in about 24% of Tiger faeces and 9% of Leopard faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, the proportion of Gaur in Tiger’s diet was about 45% in kills, 17% in scats (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Gaur together with Sambar contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Gaur is selectively predated by Tiger (Karanth and Sunquist 1995).","The set of threats and the gravity of each threat to Gaur differs greatly between south and central India, and Southeast Asia; China and most of northeast India are more similar to Southeast Asia in this respect (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008), and are so treated in the following discussion.<br/><br/>In Indochina, Myanmar, and northeast India, hunting is the major problem, compounded by loss of suitable habitat: large tracts of suitable habitat hold few or no Guar. Ongoing habitat degradation and conversion is continually reducing the potential population, should hunting be brought under control (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Choudhury 2002, Steinmetz 2004, Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006, R.J Timmins pers. comm. 2008, F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is often for meat and a variety of methods are used (Choudhury 2002). There is also a flourishing international trade in Gaur parts, both horns (decorative) and internal organs (for medicinal purposes). Given the small size of the remaining Southeast Asian subpopulations and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Myanmar during essentially opportunistic surveys, trade is clearly a major threat (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong <em>et al</em>. 1997; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The most important population in Cambodia is scattered through a forest landscape that encompasses four provinces (Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri) and five conservation areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area, Mondulkiri Protection Forest (including the Srepok Wilderness area) and Phnom Nam Lyr Wildlife Sanctuary). Hunting is still rife in much of this area, and forest fragmentation is rapidly accelerating with human population immigration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. However, although perhaps less than 20% of this area is well protected from the aforementioned threats and protected area management is only close to effective in two areas, the most significant constraint to the area’s Gaur is the long-term uncertainty of continuation of effective conservation management of the Srepok Wilderness Area and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area. Although conservation efforts for Gaur and many other species are, in both these areas, extremely encouraging, both face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the possible loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the possible loss of political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated well trained staff. Almost throughout Southeast Asia, protected areas are not yet stalling declines in mammals with commercial value, such as Gaur. Areas with stabilized populations (in addition to the two Cambodian areas, perhaps only a few areas in Thailand (see Population) and Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam) are exceptional (R. Steimetz pers. comm. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Surprisingly, given its retention of healthy populations of other high-value very large mammals (Tiger and Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>); Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 for elephants), Malaysia has among the most rapidly declining populations of Gaur. This reflects targeted hunting for large mammals of high commercial value, even within protected areas (Abdul Kadir 1998, Wan Shahruddin 1998, Lynam 1999, DWNP/Danced 2002, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007). Given the rapid decline within the 1990s and the lack of information traced since 2002, the exact current situation of Gaur in Malaysia is unclear. Kemasul Forest Reserve, where the species was found in Laidlaw’s (2000) survey of virgin jungle reserves, probably no longer exists as such. Even at the time of survey, most of the Forest Reserve was due to be converted into an <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantation, although still nominally a Forest Reserve. Kemasul was, long ago, part of a massive block of lowland forest which included the famous Jengka Triangle and Krau ""Game"" Reserve. Only Krau remains, albeit much reduced (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). Even Krau, which was set up (in 1923) principally for the protection of Gaur, numerous in the area then, faces multiple threats (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). In the surveys for DWNP/DANCED (2002), evidence of hunting, including cartridges, was found within the reserve, particularly in the easily accessible lowland areas; there were plenty of hunting stories by and about all of the different local communities, without exception, although their preferred target species differed. Conversion from natural forest to other land-uses of adjacent state-land combined with new ease of access has undoubtedly made Krau more of a focal point for such activity. There is a new (metalled) road and land conversion right up to the boundaries, facilitating access and easing the use of hunting methods such as spotlighting, as well as reducing habitat. The salt licks (for which Krau used to be famous) increasingly fall outside the forest (reflecting shrinking reserve boundaries and farmland encroachment into the reserve) and are now mostly in zones of high human activity of one sort or another. Temporary grasslands generated through traditional indigenous farming, which were often fairly difficult to get to and thus relatively free from hunting, were previously important Gaur habitat. A forester who used to work in Malaysia in the 1940s said that Gaur herds used to follow the Orang Asli settlements, moving in when they moved out, and Weigum (1972) even recommended ""...to maintain herds in the park it is recommended that 45 acres of land be clear-cut preferably in 15 acre plots ½ mile apart and be recut every three years"". Gaur meat is, or at least was being, sold at restaurants in placed like Cameron and Grik.<br/><br/>In south and central India, densities are likely to be widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock, although this conclusion is based on rather few empirical studies and there are some outstanding populations in well-secured protected areas. Substantial declines and local extinctions of Gaur were driven by hunting (for meat), competition with livestock, and habitat conversion, particularly during the first half of the twentieth century, resulting in a drastically reduced and fragmented distributional range, especially outside the protected area network (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is much less prevalent than in Southeast Asia, reflecting the general enforcement of wildlife protection laws (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Nonetheless, even in high-profile reserves, it is still suppressing densities significantly. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low, because of poaching, by comparison with what the habitat should support (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the measured density in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park was only a third of that in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, preventive measures are uneven across it, and Gaur is still poached, at least sporadically, wherever protection effectiveness is low (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Gaur, has reportedly been exterminated from three Indian protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha <em>et al</em>. 2004). Interaction with domestic stock is greatly under-appreciated as a threat to Gaur, but is probably the main factor which currently limits populations in south and central India: livestock are widely grazed even in otherwise well-managed protected areas. Mean densities of Gaur were fully 132 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas of Bandipur, and in shared grazing areas Gaur densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities; in the grazed area studied, halving the livestock density allowed increases of Gaur by a factor of 57 (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but the effects of these on Gaur populations warrant further study. Killing of Gaur in retaliation to crop damage (through consumption and trampling) occurs, but is of limited significance to conservation (Choudhury 2002, Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Some animals also die from ingestion of agrochemicals, and human response when wandering into farmland and villages; these could be significant for already isolated and reduced populations (Choudhury 2002).<br/><br/>Throughout the range, diseases, particularly rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, transmitted by domestic cattle are a potentially serious threat. Foot-and-mouth is the most frequent, but rinderpest has had a particularly dramatic impact in India and several sub-populations of Gaur were nearly destroyed as a result of the disease in 1968 (Krishnan 1972, Pal and Guin 1986, Choudhury 2002), while in Bhadra, it nearly wiped out Gaur populations in 1988–1989, when nearly 800 individuals died (Girish D.V. pers. comm. 2008). In north and central Myanmar anthrax was a major factor in the decline of the species (Salter 1983). Pasha <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered that “in fact no wild animal in India [is] so profoundly influenced by transmitted infections from domestic livestock as Gaur”. There is little research or other evidence to determine impacts of introgression with domestic oxen on Gaur populations, although such factors might be expected to be most serious in India, given the wide overlap of domestic stock with Gaur. Farshid Ahrestani (pers. comm. 2008) saw a Gaur herd of 20 individuals far from human habitation with one domestic ox in the Palni Hills, so it seems likely that introgression occurs to at least some extent.<br/><br/>Srikosamtara and Suteethorn (1995) drew attention to the pressing threats facing Gaur, placing it in the same league of trade-driven threat as better-known species such as Tiger and Asian Elephant, and emphasising the international dimension of trade. Subsequently, the population collapse in Malaysia seems to have been driven by hunting teams from Lao PDR and Thailand (as proven by language at hunting camps in Temenggor), co-opting local Malaysian associates (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). It is reasonable to expect that when returns in Malaysia drop (as they probably have done already) these teams may turn their attention to other countries’ Gaur populations.","The global population is estimated to lie within 15,000-35,000 animals. Field data suggest that the proportion of mature individuals in the population is likely to be 0.4-0.6, indicating a total of 6,000-21,000 mature individuals, with fewer than 10 populations estimated to have over 1,000 individuals. Most population figures given for numbers of Gaur are little more than guesses.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, Gaur is probably extinct (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008). A few were thought still to occur in the Chittagong, Chittagong Hill Tracts, Sylhet, and Mymensingh areas in the early 1980s (Sarker and Sarker 1984), but none had been seen in Pablakhali Wildlife Sanctuary in the Hill Tracts since the early 1970s (Khan 1985). Choudhury (2002) stated that Gaur individuals from Mizoram and Tripura (India) still cross into Bangladesh, although the records on which this was based were not given. In Bhutan, Gaur apparently persists all over the southern foot-hill zone, notably in Royal Manas National Park, Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary (Choudhury 2002).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, Gaur must have declined substantially, almost certainly by well over 50% in the period from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. However, they remained widespread, outside the lower Mekong and Tonle Sap lowlands, with large populations in some areas, although in generally low numbers overall (Heng Kimchhay <em>et al</em>. 1998, Daltry and Momberg 2000, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). From the 1990s to the present almost certainly the rate of decline increased. By far the most substantial Gaur population of the country remained in eastern Cambodia centred on Mondulkiri province, where in the late 1990s potentially several hundred to a thousand may have survived in a forested landscape of over 15,000 km²; other significant populations probably numbering in the low 100s also remained in several other areas including Virachey National Park and adjacent forests, the northern plains including Preah Vihear Protection Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, the Prey Long area of the central plains and the Cardamom Mountains (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). With increasing national stability and economic growth further declines probably of the order of 50% or more, but more importantly an almost certainly accelerating rate of decline, took place from the early 1990s to the present (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). As of 2013 the most significant population by far in Cambodia still remained within Mondulkiri Province (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013 based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. Clements pers. comm. 2007; T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2007; Gray 2012). Protection efforts in part of this landscape between 2005 and 2013 have probably stabilised the population there (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013 based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. Clements pers. comm. 2007; T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2007). However increasing pressures, including an upsurge of snaring and wild-meat demand from Vietnam, since approximately 2015 mean this protection is now not sufficient and Gaur populations are likely declining. Distance-based line transects in the landscape fail to detect sufficient Gaur (<em>c.f.</em> Banteng) to robustly estimate population size (T. Gray pers. comm). Protection outside these two areas is limited and for Cambodia as a whole the trend is still a significant decrease (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In China, Gaur occurs in Yunnan and southeast Tibet (Ma Yiqing and Wang Yingxiang 1995). Up until the 1950s–1960s, all sites in Yunnan (except Yingjiang) formed one large contiguous population, but this is now heavily fragmented. By the 1980s, the species was extinct in Lancang county, and the remaining animals were split into two populations: Xishuangbanna-Simao and Cangyuan (Wang Yingxiang verbally 1998 to Duckworth and Hedges 1998). Some sources suggest that a population of 600-800 existed in Yunnan Province in the mid-1990s, with the majority occurring in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve (Ma Yiqing and Wang Yingxiang 1995); other sources suggest that only small numbers of Gaur remain in Yunnan (along the border with Myanmar) and that hunting had led to the local extinction of Gaur in Xishuangbanna (Xiang and Santiapillai 1993).<br/><br/>In India, four major (Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, Central India and North-East) and two minor (Bihar and West Bengal) priority ‘Gaur conservation areas’ have been identified, reflecting the remaining distribution (Sankar <em>et al</em>. 2000, Choudhury 2002). The Western Ghats and their outflanking hills in south India constitute one of the most extensive extant strongholds of Gaur, with good numbers in Wynaad - Nagarahole – Mudumalai - Bandipur complex (Ranjitsinh 1997, Ahrestani and Karanth 2014). Recent distributional assessment surveys in the Karnataka part of the Western Ghats showed the presence of Gaur in more than 60% of the 22,000 km² landscape (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Ranjitsinh (1997) estimated 12,000-22,000 Gaur in India, while Choudhury (2002) suggested that there were about 23,000-34,000 Gaur in India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh; but the true number is simply not known, as shown by the wide ranges. Reliable figures on Gaur population densities are rare because of the huge effort required to sample these low-density populations in dense forested areas (Ahrestani and Karanth 2014). Major populations have been reported in Nagarahole National Park (probably over 3,000; 5.1 per 100 km²; Ahrestani and Karanth 2014), Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary (over 1000; 3 per 100 km²; Karanth 2014), Melghat Tiger Reserve (perhaps 1000; 1 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2005), Bandipur National Park (over 4,000; 5.3 per 100 km²; Ahrestani and Karanth 2014), Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and adjoining areas (over 1,500 individuals) Kanha National Park (probably around 4000; Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2015), Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh (0.7 per 100 km²; Karanth and Nichols 2000) and Maharashtra (0.8 per 100 km² ,Karanth and Kumar 2005) (perhaps &gt;500 individuals), Bhandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (re-introduced population, 65 individuals), Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (over 1,300; 1.8 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2005), Periyar Tiger Reserve and adjoining forest complex (500-1,000), Annamalai range complex (Parambikulum, Valparai, and Grass Hills) (500-700), Silent Valley and adjoining forest complex (500-1,000), Agastyamalai forest complex (about 500), Biligirirangangswamy Wildlife Sanctuary (2.8 per 100 km²; Karanth 2013) and Cauvery-Malemahadeswara Hill range (0.2 to 0.7 per 100 km²; Rayar 2010) (together over 1500), Anshi-Dandeli Tiger Reserve and adjoining forest mosaic (perhaps about 700; 1 per 100 km²; Karanth 2014), Kudremukh National Park and its adjoining forest complex including Someshwara and Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuaries (&gt;600), Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (&gt;1,200 individuals; 4.4 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2015); Satpura Tiger Reserve (&gt;1,000; 1.6 per 100 km²; Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2015). Many other areas are known or suspected to hold small populations, but in many sites such small numbers are unlikely to be viable (Choudhury 2002). For example, small populations of unknown size exist in Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary and Manas Sanctuary. Most of the foregoing figures are based on rigorous line transect survey methods. In recent years Gaur has reportedly been exterminated from three protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha <em>et al</em>. 2004). Information on population status from the states of Andhra Pradesh (probably over 300 individuals), Orissa and North-East is limited (Choudhury 2002); there are demonstrably very few Gaur in Kaziranga (Karanth and Nichols 2000). Gaur populations are known to fluctuate annually even in well-protected reserves such as Nagarahole and Bandipur (Karanth and Kumar unpub. data) due to a variety of reasons (disease outbreak, seasonal movement patterns etc). No densities could be estimated, despite the use of suitable survey methodology, at Kanha or Namdapha, implying relatively low populations, and none was found during such surveys at Kaziranga or Ranthambore (Karanth and Nichols 2000); only small numbers persist in Kaziranga (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). In Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, Tripura, North East India, the estimated population of Gaur is &lt;50 individuals with estimated density as 1.5 individuals/km² (Dasgupta <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching (using snares, dogs and shotguns) and livestock grazing. However, the Gaur population there is now steadily increasing with successful conservation interventions (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar&#160; unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared the fauna of an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site: this found respective densities of six and two Gaurs per km² (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Byers <em>et al</em>. (1995) stated that the national population was approximately 1,000. This number is possible (field records exist from many areas), but animals would have been widely dispersed and at very low density in the extensive forest tracts across the country, with perhaps fewer than six sites holding more than 50 animals (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Steinmetz 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). A large population of Gaur was found in Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and the adjoining Nakai Plateau in the mid 1990s, when signs were readily found and even the animals themselves seen directly (Duckworth 1998, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). Resurveys of both areas, although using comparable methodology only on the plateau, indicate massive declines in the subsequent decade, with, for example, fairly intensive camera-trapping not recording the species at all, although small numbers persist in localised areas of the interior (Dersu 2007; Johnson and Johnston 2007, C. Coudrat and Chanthavy Vongkhamheng in litt. to R.J. Timmins 2013). The last decade has seen major reductions (in general, probably of well over 50%), in many large mammal populations across Lao PDR and it is now likely that many of the populations listed in Duckworth and Hedges (1998) have become locally extinct (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In addition to Nakai Nam Theun NBCA, two other protected area, Nam Et–Phou Loey and Nam Kading National Biodiversity Conservation Areas have been relatively well surveyed (although not specifically for wild cattle) with disappointing results suggesting very small remnant Gaur populations, another area Xe Sap NBCA appears to retain a small but more substantial population, while a fourth area, Xe Pian NBCA, along the border with Cambodia (mainly in Champasak Province) may also have a more substantial population, but data are scarce (BirdLife International Cambodia Programme 2012, Timmins 2012, unpub. data collected for AWCSG-GWC 2011, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013, Akchousan Rasphone, J. Goodrich, C. Hallam and A. McWilliam in litt. to R.J. Timmins 2013). These five areas amount to the majority of the largest forest blocks remaining in Laos, with few other areas capable of supporting significant Gaur populations, but as of the end of 2013 it is likely that the most significant Gaur population survives in the extreme south of Lao along the border with Cambodia, particularly within Attapu province adjacent to the Virachey National Park area, in areas that remain poorly surveyed and not formally protected at the national level (unpub. data collected for AWCSG-GWC 2011, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, in 1994 the population was stated to be less than 500 individuals and it was thought to be declining (J. Brennan pers. comm. to Read <em>et al</em>. 1994; a number of other stated numbers from around that time, all of the same general order of a few hundred, and none derived allowing a quantification of error margin, are presented in Hedges in prep.), with then confirmed records from various sites, e.g., the Sungai Singgor area of Temenggor Forest Reserve, Hulu Perak (Ratnam <em>et al</em>. 1995). In the subsequent few years, the population collapsed, despite optimism through relatively stronger control of guns in Malaysia than elsewhere on the southeast Asian mainland, and a perception (e.g., Nash 1993) of relatively strict control of wildlife trade in Malaysia. Densities in Taman Negara were crudely estimated from surveys during 1999-2001 as 0, 3 and 22 Gaurs per 100 km² in three study sites (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004). Although these authors adjudged large mammal poaching to be negligible in Taman Negara, high levels were confirmed there by Wan Shahruddin (1998) and camera-trapping (suitable in methodology and intensity to find Gaur if any significant numbers were present) did not record Gaur at a fourth sector of Taman Negara in 1999 (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007). In 2015, camera-trapping work done by MYCAT in south-western Taman Negara corridor (outside the park) showed the existence of Gaur. How many animals were not ascertained. Also camera-trap of individuals and prints were seen in Taman Negara, the wildlife corridor as well as in the contiguous forest adjoining it (M.T. Gumal pers. comm 2016). No Gaur was photographed at all in eight other potential Tiger areas surveyed by Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2007) during 1997-1999, including Temenggor (see Ratnam <em>et al</em>. 1995); because these were selected as the areas most likely to support Tigers and as Tiger-oriented camera-trapping elsewhere in South-east Asia usually yields photographs of Gaur, this study proves that only very low numbers of Gaur remain in Malaysia, no doubt way below the estimate in Read et al. (1994). However WWF Malaysia does have records of Gaur still existing in Belum-Temenggor (M.T. Gumal pers. comm. 2016). Further supporting this,none was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006). Gaur was found in only two of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas), making it among the most localised mammal species which was detected in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves. The two occupied sites were a contiguous pair in each management class, and among the biggest sites surveyed (over 100 km²); the virgin jungle reserves themselves rarely exceed 3 km² (Laidlaw 2000). Also the Endau-Rompin landscape has been camera trapped between 2008 to 2015, and with 231 camera-trap stations and found no signs of Gaur (an effective camera trapping area of 4,179 km²) (M.T. Gumal pers. comm 2016).<br/><br/>In the 1960s, there were estimated to be approximately 40 Gaur in Krau Wildlife Reserve, a figure deemed optimistic at the time; in the 1980s there were thought to be 22-31; in 1995 the estimate was only seven. When surveying the reserve in 2000 (see DWNP/DANCED 2002), R. Dunlop (pers. comm. 2008) covered the whole reserve (about 440 km²) with camera-traps in 119 one km-grid squares. Out of a total of 6,918 periods of 24-hour trapping, 61 species were recorded in 1,804 photographs of wildlife, yet only one photograph was of a Gaur. In almost 100 days of field searching for signs, Gaur tracks were recorded only on eight days, on each occasion as prints of isolated animals. The photograph, the sole sighting, and the eight track records were all in the south-east lowland area of the reserve, moving between an area of salt-licks and grazing just outside the reserve. This survey corroborated the 1995 estimate of seven animals, and the 2000-2001 figure could be even lower. Sumatran Rhinoceros (<em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em>) and Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) have both disappeared from Krau, and Gaur may be the next species to go. R. Dunlop (pers. comm. 2008) considers there no reason to expect this recent history not to typify that of Gaur populations at all sites in Malaysia. There are very recent records from: Tanjong Mentong in Taman Negara, where tracks were found during elephant surveys in late 2006 (Nurul Huda, WCS Malaysia pers. comm. 2008); Belum, in 2007, where animals were camera-trapped at salt-licks several times, including a herd of seven (Ahmad Zafir, WWF Malaysia pers. comm. 2008); and Temenggor, where individual animals (no herds) were camera-trapped nine times (never at salt licks, always on logging roads) in 2,364 trap-nights in 25 locations (Mark Darmaraj, WWF Malaysia pers. comm. 2008). A recent camera trapping study of fruiting gardens, which conducted 1024 camera trap nights at 15 sites within Krau, found no sign of Gaur (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, the status of Gaur is poorly known (J.W. Duckworth and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006). A March 1994 survey of Taminthi Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar's largest protected area, guessed that 100-200 Gaur remained, and that they were in danger of being extirpated from the area if current levels of poaching continued (Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1995). A national Tiger survey camera-trapped Gaur in 11 of 15 camera-trapped sites, commonly in several (Lynam 2003); these sites were selected for their chances of holding Tigers, so, because the two species face similar threats, it may present the most positive picture of Gaur occurrence in the country.<br/><br/>In Nepal, the Gaur population was estimated to be 250-350 in the mid-1990s, with the majority in Chitwan National Park and Parsa Wildlife Reserve; a few other areas hold small numbers (Choudhury 2002). In total the population of this species is more or less stable, with some annual fluctuations. A 2008 census in Parsa Wildlife Reserve counted up to 37 Gaur, in 2011 a combined survey of Parsa Wildlife Reserve and Chitwan National Park counted 21 and 312 respectively. In 2013, Parsa Wildlife Reserve showed a total of 69 animals, a marked increase from the last count. The Gaur population found in east Nepal mainly confined to Trijuga forest, Udayapur District has been nearly extirpated. Currently national count is being held and it is expected that the numbers will be higher than previous years. The rough estimate is around 400 in Nepal.<br/><br/>In Thailand, an estimated total of 920 Gaur remained in 1994. Only 6-7 populations were thought to contain 50 or more animals and there were no Gaur outside protected areas. The most important protected areas for Gaur were Khao Yai National Park, Tap Lan National Park and Pang Sida National Park, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaeng Krachan National Park and Mae Nam Phachi Wildlife Sanctuary, the Khlong Nakha complex, and possibly Om Koi and Mae Tuen Wildlife Sanctuaries. Even in protected areas with much suitable habitat Gaur densities were very low, for example in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary the population density was less than 50% of the estimated carrying capacity of the area (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1995, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000). Gaur populations are probably now increasing in several sites in Thailand, notably in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, with effective tackling of poaching. In Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, sign monitoring in one small area (20 km²) over six years since poaching absolutely ceased indicated an annual population growth rate there of 0.31, although the relative contributions of birth and immigration could not be distinguished. Breeding herds became much more common, compared with the situation 10-15 years previously at the height of poaching (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the Khao Paeng Ma reforestation site adjacent to Khao Yai National Park the population apparently expanded from two to 100 Gaur in less than 10 years, initially reflecting recolonization but apparently mostly from reproduction among animals at the site, all within a 10 km² area of secondary forest. The population stabilized at about 100 animals during 2004â€“2007 (based on counts from hilltops). As the forest grows and browse and grass diminish, reproduction is likely to decline (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). This herd has flourished only by dint of the provision of 24-hour security (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). Numbers also seem to be expanding rapidly in Kuiburi National Park in southern Thailand, again from an artificially lowered population and again within a secondary forest area adjacent to semi-evergreen forest. In early 2008, a (temporary) herd of almost 50 animals was spotted by elephant-watchers in a tree hide; only a few years previously, there were probably far fewer than this in the whole area (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007; R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). By contrast, Gaur is largely gone from southern Thailand forest remnants, although it may be safe on the Malaysian border, reflecting tight control of illegal access and activities by the Border Patrol Police, and the danger of operations because of insurgency (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the current status of Gaur is poorly known. Several areas in Dak Lak Province (the Easo and Easup areas and Yok Don National Park) were known to contain Gaur in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997) but very little reliable information was traced for other parts of the country by Duckworth and Hedges (1998). Several herds of Gaur persist in Cat Tien National Park and in adjacent state forest enterprises (Polet and Ling 2004), where the population is now probably stable and even perhaps increasing (based on various secondary and verbal sources R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). Elsewhere however there seems little room for doubt that the Gaur population is still threatened, although at this point in time (late 2013) it is possible even probable that Gaur have largely been extirpated from all areas where no form of protection exists, and that even in most protected areas that harbour residual groups that declines are still the predominant trend, and many of the sites reported in Duckworth and Hedges (1998) may now have lost the species.",Decreasing,"Gaur historically occurred throughout mainland south and southeast Asia and Sri&#160;Lanka. Currently it occurs in scattered areas in the following range states:&#160;Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Lao PDR, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia only),&#160;Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Viet Nam. However, it is extinct in Sri Lanka and also, as&#160;a resident, apparently in Bangladesh (Grubb 2005, Md Anwarul Islam in litt.&#160;2008, Hedges in prep.). The species is now seriously fragmented within its&#160;range, and the mapped distribution is generalised, especially in India, Lao, Myanmar, China and Malaysia.The domesticated form of Gaur, considered by IUCN a separate species (<em>Bos&#160;frontalis</em>; Mythun, Mithan or Gayal), occurs in parts of India, China, and&#160;Myanmar as feral, semi-feral, and domestic animals. This animal is excluded from&#160;the red-listing considerations for Gaur.","The Gaur is hunted for food, medicinal products and handicrafts products. A domesticated 'form' of Gaur (considered by many, including for Red List purposes as a separate species <em>Bos frontalis</em>) occurs in parts of the Indian subcontinent and is used as a draught animal and for meat. However such uses do not supply the same markets as 'wild' Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> products.",Terrestrial,"Gaur is listed in CITES Appendix I, and is legally protected in all range states. It occurs in many protected areas, although in north-east India, Myanmar, China, Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Malaysia many such areas retain only tiny populations or have already lost the species.<br/><br/>South and central India have a well established network of wildlife refuges and protection activities, to a large extent, are effective in many of them (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008) and Gaur population in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in South India is perhaps the most secure one (Ahrestani and Karanth 2014) with about 5000 individuals (also the largest population of Gaurs in the world). However, conservation-oriented research and interventions on Gaur are limited and seem unlikely to expand much in the short-term, meaning that the species benefits largely through general protection activities (particularly those focused around Tiger and Asian Elephant), while species-specific negative factors or worrying long-term trends are likely to go unmanaged and even unnoticed (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). The chief of these seems to be competitive interaction with grazing stock: Gaur densities were the most depressed of all ungulates surveyed by Madhusudan (2004), perhaps reflecting higher niche overlap with domestic cattle than shown by the others (chiefly deer). There is long-term monitoring of some Gaur populations, for instance Mudumalai, Bandipur, Bhadra and Nagarahole (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008, Karanth and Kumar unpub. data). Rinderpest has reportedly been eradicated from India (Choudhury 2002). Choudhury (2002) listed proposed aspects of protected area expansion and consolidation to slow further fragmentation of Gaur populations in southern and central India. <br/><br/>In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Gaur (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth et al. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Gaur populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that out migration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>In contrast in Southeast Asia economic development and political stability in tandem with increased globalisation has resulted in accelerated loss and fragmentation of Gaur habitat, greater wildlife trade demand and a more insidious trade network (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Gaur population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Gaur presence through its historical range, to preserve Gaur genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region. <br/><br/>Gaur occurs mainly in protected areas in Southeast Asia, although Cambodia and Myanmar may both have large populations outside them and some may persist is such areas in Lao PDR (Duckworth 1996, Hansel 2004, SUFORD 2010). In most protected areas of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia which still retain Gaur, protected status offers little, if any, real protection to the species, exceptions being Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam, the Srepok Wilderness Area and the Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area in Cambodia; in the latter two Cambodian areas, there are now even signs of population recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), as there are at Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, with effective tackling of poaching (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary form part of Thailand's 'Western Forest Complex' which if these recent gains are consolidated will, in the long term, hold the largest functional Gaur population in Thailand and perhaps South-east Asia. <br/><br/>The most important conservation measure for the species in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area and the Srepok Wilderness Area, and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, in Thailand it is to continue the consolidation of the 'Western Forest Complex' and to continue the high-intensity protection of the rebuilt herd in Khao Paeng Ma reforestation site, adjacent to Khao Yai National Park. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Part lies within the Wildlife Sanctuary and some of the rest of the outstanding plains habitat is within an enormous proposed extension. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Gaur conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Xe Sap, Nam Et-Phou Louey, and Nakai-Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Steinmetz 2004, Johnson et al. 2006, Timmins 2012) but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Gaur conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Gaur as the focus for efforts. Choudhury (2002) listed aspects of protected area expansion and consolidation to slow further fragmentation of Gaur populations in north-east India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and perhaps allow repopulation of Bangladesh. <br/><br/>The most important actions in Malaysia are to determine if any viable population remains in the country and, if so, to implement effective anti-poaching measures and to work at the policy level to allow effective control of large mammal hunting and trading. Under the current circumstances, any site-based activities are likely to require the sort of 24-hour security employed at the reforestation site adjacent to Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, which has allowed a rapid population growth of Gaur. It may also require reintroduction. The Department of Wildlife and National Parks have a breeding population of captive Gaur in enclosures in the Jenderak ranger station (within Krau Wildlife Reserve), for captive release. <br/><br/>A large captive population exists of wild-type Gaur (as well as of Mythun); given the complexity of field conservation of large ungulates, particularly in South-east Asia, it is clearly in resolving issues of hunting, trade, and protected area effectiveness that conservation interventions must focus.",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

There have been five attempts to compile national estimates, of varying data quality, to determine global Snow Leopard global population size. Two sets contain estimates largely dating prior to 2003: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). Two sets date from 2008-2010: 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 4,678 to 8,745 (a compilation of individual population estimates for prime habitat covering about 1/3 of likely extant range developed at an expert mapping workshop in 2008 but not available until 2016: McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). The most recent set of national estimates comes from country chapters in the comprehensive book <em>Snow Leopards</em>: 7,463 to 7,980 (McCarthy and Mallon 2016, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016: Table 1 in the Supporting Information). While all these sets of estimates exclude dependent cubs, a population modelling exercise was carried out in 2015 to exclude young adults which may not be capable of breeding (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Model outputs for nine different scenarios were applied to the most conservative possible global population estimate available at the time (4,000), resulting in a number of mature individuals between 2,710 and 3,386. The number of mature individuals would be roughly double if applied to the upper bounds of the more recent estimates published in 2016.<br/><br/>There is virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales; Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others, including recent localized extinctions which may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union. A decline of at least 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction. Although poaching appears to have declined since the late 1990s, Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2016) estimated that 221-450 Snow Leopards were poached annually since 2008 (based on extrapolation of cases known to over 40 surveyed experts); these were attributed to retaliation for actual or perceived livestock depredation, but this supposition is not substantiated by hard evidence. With the average rate of poaching detection estimated by experts at less than 38%, these numbers could be substantially higher. If these poaching estimates are anywhere near accurate, this suggests that roughly 2-10% of the population could be poached annually. While a direct relationship between offtake and a population decline is not clear, even at the magnitude reported by Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, it adds to the plausibility of a 10% decline over 3 generations (22.62 years).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty</strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria are designed to incorporate the use of inference, suspicion and projection, to allow taxa to be assessed in the absence of detailed and complete data, which are rarely available across the entire range of a taxon; the absence of high-quality data should not deter attempts at applying the criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016). Throughout this assessment, we have attempted to show the degree to which we have dealt with uncertainty stemming from the paucity of data for this elusive and secretive species. To ensure this assessment is both “precautionary and credible,"" as specified by IUCN (2012), a range of values as well as best estimates were considered for the critical parameters, including those used in modelling the number of 'mature individuals' (MI) in the population. Specifically, the model dealt with uncertainty by including a variety of scenarios with cats maturing between 2 to 4 years of age, and then applied the resultant MI percent to the lowest published population estimate which, contrary to convention, included dependent yearlings (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Here, even the very lowest bound of the estimated range of mature individuals did not fall within the threshold for the Endangered category.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that precise and robust estimates of Snow Leopard density are difficult to obtain, are available for only a limited proportion of the global range, and represent small study sites selected for their suitability for the species. Because extrapolation to larger areas or even range-wide would be tenuous, we have avoided doing so in all cases. Estimates of Snow Leopard population size based on rigorous study design and survey methodology are sparse. The national population estimates cited here are considered to be the best available, following advice in the Red List Guidelines: “<strong>The plausible range may be established using.….. the opinion of a single expert, or the consensus view of a group of experts</strong>” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016).<br/><br/>There is also a lack of hard data on overall population trends, which hinders estimates of the magnitude of any decline which rely on fragmentary evidence and are therefore largely speculative. Nonetheless, the evidence considered does not suggest that the situation has deteriorated since 2008, which would be needed to justify an Endangered listing under criterion C1.<br/><br/><strong>Reasons for Change in IUCN Red List Status</strong><br/>The previous assessment in 2008 (Endangered C1) was based on &lt;2,500 mature  individuals and an estimated decline of 20% over 16  years (two generations). However, in that assessment, effective  population size  (Ne) was incorrectly used as a surrogate for ‘mature  individuals’ and  produces a lower figure (50% of the adult population of  4,080).  Therefore, the species should have been listed as Vulnerable in  2008.<br/><br/>Moreover, given the apparent limits to dispersal (Riordan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>   2015), it is questionable whether such a small number of individuals   capable of breeding (and therefore fewer actually breeding) is   demographically viable over such an extensive range. Recent survey   information indicates that Snow Leopard densities in several areas are   higher than previously believed, implying that the overall population   size is also likely to be larger than the minimum estimates (Jackson<em> et  al.</em>  2010, SLSS 2014, McCarthy and Mallon 2016). The revised estimate of   the number of mature individuals addressed the earlier mistake, in   combination with new information, and the change from EN to VU is therefore a non-genuine change.<br/><br/>The   estimated 20% decline over 16 years in 2008 included a documented   upsurge in poaching for skins and body parts in the countries of Central   Asia, following the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1991. While   this threat has since subsided, it is unlikely to have completely   disappeared. The other traditional threats still exist, alongside   emerging potential threats such as mining and other infrastructure   development (roads, railroads, hydro-dams, etc.), some of which will have   intensified in recent years (summaries in Snow Leopard Network 2014,   McCarthy and Mallon 2016).<br/><br/>There have also been very significant   investments in conservation measures to reduce threats or to mitigate   their effects. These include: establishment of new protected areas in   Snow Leopard range; more effective anti-poaching measures; training and   capacity-building of range country conservation professionals; a number   of independent initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g.,   strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and   alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides); community engagement   programmes; the illegalization of guns in China since 1989; and   education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its   habitat (see the <em>Conservation Measures</em> section for more details and  examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008  (Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem  Protection Program (Snow  Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the  revised version of the Snow  Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard  Network 2014) have all enhanced  the global strategic framework.<br/><br/>Although  the Snow Leopard undoubtedly is still threatened, the  measures listed  above are collectively considered to have contributed  to improving the  overall conservation situation for Snow Leopards since  2008. The  generation length of 8 years used in 2008 has been revised to 7.54 years  following Pacifici <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013).  There is no current evidence to  support a decline of 20% over such a  short period of 15.08 years, as  needed to support a listing as  Endangered, and which would represent a  steeper decline and therefore a  deterioration in the situation since  2008. However, in view of the  existing and emerging threats, a decline  of 10% or more over 22.62  years (three generations) is considered plausible  (starting in 2014). This  change in the estimated rate of decline is the  result of conservation  actions taken, so potentially could qualify as genuine change and  on this basis IUCN's 5-year waiting period would apply, dated from the first  draft of this  assessment (June 2014).&#160;However, since the EN category in 2008  was incorrect, the species should have been listed as VU in 2008, the  change in category is therefore non-genuine.","Snow Leopards inhabit mountainous rangelands at elevations of 3,000 to over 5,000 m in the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, but can occur as low as 500 m in the Altai (Snow Leopard Network 2014). Wild caprids are the principal natural prey of Snow Leopards, especially Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) and Siberian Ibex <em></em>(<em>Capra sibirica</em>), whose distribution coincides closely with Snow Leopard range. Argali (<em>Ovis ammon) </em>and Markhor (<em>Capra</em> <em>falconeri</em>) are also important prey in some areas. Primary productivity in Snow Leopard habitat is relatively low due to low temperatures and high aridity, consequently, the density of ungulate prey also tends to be relatively low, with reports ranging from 0.9 to 10.2 animals per km² (e.g., Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Wild prey abundance is one of the main determinants of Snow Leopard abundance (Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Snow Leopard diet is dominated by wild caprids, reportedly contributing 45% to 98% of the diet, while livestock may contribute 40-70%, though generally more on the order of 15-30% (Schaller <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987, Oli<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>1994, Chundawat and Rawat 1994, Jackson 1996, Bagchi and Mishra 2006, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Shezad <em>et al<em>.</em></em> 2012, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Smaller prey reported in Snow Leopard diet (approximately 12–25%) include marmots (<em>Marmota </em>spp.), pika (<em>Ochotona </em>spp.), hares (<em>Lepus </em>spp.), small rodents, and birds. It appears that the contribution of small sized prey in Snow Leopard diet may have been overestimated in earlier studies due to inadvertent inclusion of scats of other carnivores such as foxes (<em>Vulpes</em> spp.) in the analyses of Snow Leopard diet. Results of recent studies that have confirmed the identity of scats through faecal DNA (e.g., Anwar <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2013) or examined prey DNA in scats (Shezad<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2012) report the contribution of small sized prey to be relatively low (2-8%).<br/><br/>Although Snow Leopards may occur in relatively flat or rolling areas such as in parts of Mongolia and the Tibetan Plateau (Schaller 1998, McCarthy 2000), within their habitat, they favour steep, rugged and broken terrain and rocky outcrops (Jackson<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Mountain ridges, cliff edges, and well-defined drainage lines serve as common travel routes and sites for the deposition of signs, including scrapes, scats, and scent marks (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988).<br/><br/>There is substantial variation in the reported home range sizes of Snow Leopards. An earlier study in Nepal based on ground-based very high frequency (VHF) tracking reported home ranges of five individuals between 12 and 39 km², with substantial overlap between individuals and sexes (Jackson and Ahlborn 1989). However, the home range of a single Snow Leopard radio-collared in 2013 in Nepal using a satellite collar was estimated to be &gt; 400 km² (Rinjan Shreshtha, WWF, pers. comm). McCarthy <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>(2005) reported home range size of four Snow Leopards based on VHF tracking in Mongolia to range between 13 and 141 km², while the satellite-monitored home range of one of these individuals in the same study was at least 15 times higher. In the most current and comprehensive study to have been undertaken, home ranges of 18 individuals monitored between 2008 and 2014 using Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite telemetry in Mongolia ranged from approximately 100 to &gt;1,000 km² (SLT, Panthera and SLCF, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>A four-year camera trapping study in Mongolia reveals considerable underlying dynamics in an otherwise stable population of Snow Leopards, with the adult sex ratio apparently changing from being male-biased to female-biased during the study period (1.67 to 0.38 males per female, Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This is the first study to estimate vital rates including probabilities of immigration and emigration. The adult survival probability for the study population was estimated at 0.83 (Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","Appendix 2 of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) provides a global and country-by-country threat assessment based on the GSLEP-supported exercise drawing loosely on the Threats Reduction Assessment (TRA) protocol of Salafsky and Margoluis (1999) and involving select experts from each range country. McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: <br/><br/>Recently Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","There are no robust estimates of Snow Leopard global population size and the various figures available are best regarded as guesses: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003); 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). There are several difficulties to overcome in making reliable estimates of Snow Leopard population size (Snow Leopard Network 2014), namely this species’ secretive nature, generally low density, sparse (or sporadic) distribution and remote terrain contributing to generally low detection rates and small sample sizes that in turn may make extrapolation problematic. Until recently, most studies were conducted over rather small areas, sometimes smaller than the home range of a single Snow Leopard, rendering the information inadequate to make population and density inferences over larger areas (Appendix 1 in Snow Leopard Network 2014). Furthermore, not all studies report the size of the surveyed area, thus precluding generation of density estimates. These limitations are starting to be addressed, for example through the adoption of more robust methods, such as spatially-explicit recapture models from camera data (e.g., Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Additionally, recently published information includes relatively rigorous surveys conducted over larger areas (see below).<br/><br/>Snow Leopards are known to breed at 2 or 3 years of age (Leif Blomqvist, International Snow Leopard Studbook Keeper, Helsinki Zoo, pers. comm., Jay Tetzloff, US Association of Zoos and Aquariums Snow Leopard Species Survival Plan Coordinator, pers. comm., McCarthy and Chapron 2003). Field observations are consistent with Snow Leopards breeding at 2 or 3 years of age. Of two known-age females in a long-term radio-telemetry study of Snow Leopards in Mongolia, one gave birth at the age of 3 years and the other at age 3 or 4 years (O. Johansson, pers. comm. and Panthera/Snow Leopard Trust unpublished data). Since breeding occurs in February/March and birth occurs in May/June, this means that one female definitely bred at age 2 years and the second bred when either 2 or 3 years old. Two other females of estimated age in the same study likely gave birth when 3-4 years old, again indicating successful breeding at 2-3 years old. Sexual maturity and breeding at 2-3 years old appears to be consistent across a range of large wild felids (Berry <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Hunter 1998, Kelly <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Hunter <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Miller 2013, Miller and Funston 2014).<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016) define 'mature individuals' as individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction. The guidelines also state that age of first reproduction in the wild may be later than the age at which an individual is biologically capable of breeding. Hence, mature individuals in the Red List context are those capable of breeding, not just those actually breeding in any given year. Snow Leopards are capable of breeding beginning at 2 years of age and thus meet the IUCN definition of mature individuals, even if they do not actually start to breed this young.<br/><br/>Estimating the percent of mature individuals (≥  2 years of age) in the wild Snow Leopard population has been historically difficult, but with the extensive application of camera trapping new information is available. In 21 camera trapping studies conducted in 6 countries between 2003 and 2014 and comprising more than 29,165 trap-nights, a mean of 82.3% of Snow Leopards captured in photos were independent animals (Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information). Snow Leopards become independent at between 18 and 26 months old, hence, a small percent of independent cats in camera trap photos may not yet have reached the mature age class (2-year olds).<br/><br/>With few exceptions, published felid population estimates do not include dependent cubs. Camera-trapping derived density estimates are an example where exclusion of cubs applies. The global population estimate of 4,080-6,590 Snow Leopards (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) only includes mature individuals. Similarly, the 2008 Red List assessment (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008) for Snow Leopard states that the population estimate is for adults only and the authors calculate effective population size (2,040) as 50% of the estimated total number of adults (4,080), citing Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007). Hence, for the purposes of estimating the percent of mature individuals, published Snow Leopard population estimates should be considered to be comprised of adults only.<br/><br/>Population modelling can be used to estimate the percent of individuals in each age class. McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015 (Appendix 2 in supplementary material) employed a stochastic age-structured population model to produce a suite of stable stage population matrices. Vital rate input variables included the age at which Snow Leopards become capable of reproduction (mature), and the percentage of each age class that actually bred. The proportion of yearlings in the population estimate varied in the model from 0% to 50%. The model was run using nine scenarios of various combinations of vital rates and percentages of yearlings in the population. The lowest percentage of mature individuals (MI) was obtained when 2-year old maturity rates were lowest (25%), actual breeding did not begin until age 3, and the proportion of cubs in the population estimate was highest (50%). Yet even in that most precautionary scenario a mean MI of 67.7% (s.d. = 2.07) was obtained. Applying that MI percent to the most conservative global population estimate of 4,000 individuals, yields 2,710 (s.d. = 83) mature individuals. Model outputs for all nine scenarios when applied to this minimum population of 4,000 ranged from 2,710 to 3,386 MI. In no case did MI fall below the threshold required for an Endangered designation for the species.<br/><br/>A population of &lt; 2,500 mature individuals distributed across 1,776,000 km² (taking a relatively conservative estimate of global range size from Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) or a maximum of 3,300,000 km² (Snow Leopard Network 2014) equates to a density of one Snow Leopard capable of reproduction per 710 km² or 1,320 km² respectively. We question how such a scenario would be demographically viable; and in fact, recent best-practice density estimates largely range from 1 to over 3 per 100 km² for areas surveyed to date (see below).<br/><br/>Doubt is also being cast on the lower estimates of the global Snow Leopard population size through the expansion of field surveys in recent years and the application of more sophisticated and reliable survey techniques (such as systematic camera trapping, faecal genotyping and satellite collaring). Recent studies have confirmed the presence of Snow Leopards in new areas or their reappearance in former areas. Snow Leopards returned to the Sagarmatha area, Nepal, in 2002-2003 after an absence of <em>ca</em> 25 years (Lovari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ferretti <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Snow Leopard presence in the Vakhan Range of Tajikistan was confirmed by camera-trapping for the first time in 2011 (Diment <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and in the Kizilsu area of the Gissar Nature Reserve in Uzbekistan in 2013 (Panthera, unpublished data). In other areas, studies have indicated stable or even circumstantial evidence of increasing populations. In Wakhan District (10,000 km²) in Afghanistan, the National Environmental Protection Agency reports that numbers of Snow Leopards and one of their main prey, argali <em>Ovis ammon</em>, have increased in recent years (www.khaama.org 06 August 2015). The Snow Leopard population in Tost Uul, South Gobi, Mongolia, has been the object of the most intensive (and reliable) research to date using satellite collaring and camera trapping and was reported to be stable during the course of four years of study (Sharma <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This site was completely unprotected until recently.<br/><br/>A review of the majority of camera trap and genetic surveys to date indicate densities in excess of 1.5 adults per 100 km². Densities of 0.87-2.85 and 0.32-1.62 per 100 km² were reported at two sites in the Eastern Pamirs (Kachel 2014). In Bhutan, there is a “bright future for Snow Leopards” (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016) and density in Wangchuk Centennial Park, Bhutan was estimated at 2.39/100 km² by Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2013). Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2014) found even higher densities in Bhutan’s Jigme Dorji National Park (6.2/100 km²) and estimated that the protected area could harbour as many as 192 Snow Leopards, which is nearly equal to the high end of the estimate for the entire country (200). At six sites in Ladakh-Spiti, India, densities were 0.45, 0.74, 1.17, 1.66, 1.94, and 3.3 per 100 km² (Suryawanshi <em>et al</em>. 2013). Density in Sarychat-Ertash State Reserve, Kyrgyzstan, was 1.38 per 100 km² (Jumabay-uulu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which is a reserve that Koshkarev and Vyrypaev (2000) pointed to as having been ‘absolutely trapped out’, with surveys in 1999 finding no sign of Snow Leopards after the post-Soviet declines earlier that decade.<br/><br/>In China, Snow Leopard presence has been confirmed at numerous locations across all parts of the range, including areas where the species was thought to have disappeared such as Inner Mongolia (Riordan and Shi 2016). The Second National Biodiversity Survey of China being undertaken by the State Forestry Administration suggests that there have been improvements for Snow Leopard and their ecosystems across the country since the first assessment reported in 1995. Snow Leopard populations in the Sanjiangyuan region are believed to have increased in the last 20 years along with those of a major prey species, Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Camera-trap surveys in Suojia (also in Sanjiangyuan) indicated densities of 3.1/100 km² (Li 2012). Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015), using spatially-explicit recapture models, reported 3.31 Snow Leopards/100 km² in the Qilian Shan range, where surveys in the 1980s suggested densities &lt; 1/100 km². Schaller (2014) resurveyed portions of the Qilian Shan range in Qinghai 29 years after he first surveyed the area and although direct comparisons were not made they saw more Snow Leopard sign and more Blue Sheep in their recent surveys. Qinghai Forestry Department recently increased their estimate for the province to at least 1,000 individuals based on camera trapping surveys (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Riordan and Shi (2016) estimate Snow Leopard populations for each province in China, totalling at least 4,500 for the whole country. Since China contains c. 60% of the overall range this figure implies that the global population may possibly reach 7,500, broadly in line with the upper estimates described above. The current situation for Snow Leopard in China is a result of new information emerging as survey effort improves, as well as positive effects of the illegalization of firearms in China in 1989, along with hunting bans in key provinces, and greater awareness of the national importance of Snow Leopards.<br/><br/>Some, but not all, of the recent studies have been in protected areas or locations thought to have good populations of Snow Leopards, so densities might be higher there than elsewhere, and thus these figures are not easily extrapolated to the entire range. However, taken together, and considering the widely spread localities within the overall distribution of Snow Leopards, these figures do seem to suggest that the global population size is closer to the upper end of the estimates cited above, rather than the lower end.<br/><br/>Two sets of global population estimates published in 2015, after the modelling exercise in Appendix 2 (in the Supporting Information) was carried out, also suggest that Snow Leopard numbers are higher than previously estimated in 2003. In 2008, an expert knowledge process was used to map current Snow Leopard range and identify important Snow Leopard Conservation Units (SLCUs) within that range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Experts from all range states and global experts participated and identified 69 SLCUs. Adequate information was available to estimate Snow Leopard population size in 56 SLCUs, placing it at 4,678 to 8,745 adults and large sub-adults within an area of 875,818 km², or about 31.5% of currently occupied range. The population trend was considered to be stable or increasing in 33 (48%) of SLCUs and decreasing in only 15 (22%), while no information on trend was reported by experts in 11 (30%) of the units. Notably, experts indicated that most population and trend estimates they provided came from recent research as opposed to previous ‘guesstimates’ lacking field-based evidence.<br/><br/>With the recent publication of the first ever comprehensive book on the species (McCarthy and Mallon 2016), additional light has been shed on current Snow Leopard population estimates in most of the 12 range countries. National experts authored individual chapters providing updates on the status of the species in their home countries. With the exception of Bhutan those chapters included current population estimates; taking the high and low values of the population ranges provided (Table 1 in the Supporting Information) a range-wide population of 7,367-7,884 is indicated. If the results of the 2014-2016 Bhutan Snow Leopard census are added in (79-112: Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016), the global population would then be estimated at 7,446 to 7,996. This indicates that Snow Leopards are likely more numerous than historic estimates suggest, perhaps substantially so. It should be noted that this represents better knowledge and not necessarily a population increase.<br/><br/>There is little evidence to indicate that small-scale fragmentation and lack of connectivity are significant issues, despite the typically insular nature of mountain habitat and the species’ preference for steep or broken terrain. Most of Snow Leopard range is more or less contiguous and it is difficult to delimit separate subpopulations (Jackson, unpub. data; Janecka, unpub. data); furthermore, other than major rivers along the periphery of Snow Leopard range, some border fences, and short sections of railroads or major highways, there currently appear to be few major barriers to restrict movement. The Mongolia telemetry study has confirmed that Snow Leopards are capable of crossing open habitat (desert plains) in excess of 100 km (Panthera/SLT unpublished data) and Snow Leopards have been encountered attempting to cross the Chinese Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia on at least three occasions (Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, Nei Mongol Wildlife Division, pers. comm). Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015) used resistant kernel modelling to assess connectivity and predicted two regional populations, in the north and south of the species range, and identified several potentially important connecting areas. Snow Leopard range in Nepal lies in five “relatively contiguous habitat blocks” (Ale <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); in Pakistan, there is “confirmed presence over large landscapes” (Ud-Din and Nawaz<em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); the range in Bhutan is virtually contiguous across the whole of the north of the country (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016); in Sanjiangyuan region, a key Snow Leopard habitat in China, “there are abundant connections between important habitats” (Li 2012, Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Current Population Trend</strong>:<br/>Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others. Recent localized extinctions may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union (Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Evidence of increased or re-established populations described above may in some cases be a consequence of enhanced survey effort in previously unsurveyed areas, although conservation actions and policies will have no doubt helped. However, there remains a lack of sufficiently longitudinal surveys, except in very few sites, and thus we have virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales. This is an information gap that urgently needs to be filled in order to validate this and all future Red List assessments and provide a reliable basis from which to evaluate conservation actions and measure their impact.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Past </strong><br/>Population reductions in the Central Asian republics—which represent only 7% of the global occupied range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016)—following the collapse of the Soviet Union are thought to have been as high as 40-75% during the 1990s. There is no evidence to indicate such high rates of decline continued beyond the late 1990s.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Future</strong> <br/>Recent surveys in Pakistan suggest that Snow Leopard numbers in parts of the country may be lower than previously thought (Snow Leopard Foundation, unpublished reports, Nawaz and Hameed 2015) and may experience further decline in the future. Localized extinctions, such as those documented by Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) in parts of the Alay region of Kyrgyzstan, may be expected in other isolated sites in Central Asia. There are also growing threats from extractive industries across the species’ range and potential impacts from climate change which may influence population trends. Despite positive conditions described previously, a decline of 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated in light of localized declines given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction (see below). However, projecting rural development more than 3-5 years into the future is difficult, even in countries with well-articulated 5-10 year Development Plans, environmental impact laws or robust protocols for forecasting economic growth.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Population Reduction - Ongoing</strong> <br/>Current reductions appear to be modest and local, likely driven by a declining natural prey base, localized poaching for skins, and sporadic but apparently increasing human-wildlife conflict resulting from depredation of livestock. Growing flocks of sheep and goats and a thriving meat (e.g., Nepal and Pakistan) and cashmere trade (China and Mongolia) appear to lie at the root of these inter-connected threats (Berger <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). However, where not mitigated, the mix of livestock-wild ungulate competition, associated rangeland degradation, declining natural prey numbers and Snow Leopard predation of livestock would likely accelerate retributive killing by herders, who could also be expected to offset their economic losses by funnelling Snow Leopard body parts into the illegal trade network.",Decreasing,"The range of the Snow Leopard extends from the Himalaya in the south, across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the mountains of Central Asia to the mountains of southern Siberia in the north. It occurs in the Altai, Sayan, Tien Shan, Kunlun, Pamir, Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and outer Himalayan ranges and in smaller isolated mountains in the Gobi region. It occurs in 12 countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A small area of potential range occurs in northern Myanmar but recent Snow Leopard presence has not been confirmed. The area of occupied range was recently estimated to be about 2.8 million km² (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","Poaching and illegal trade has been a traditional threat and continues in many parts of the range. Currently, the demand for rugs, luxury décor, and taxidermy, especially from China and Eastern Europe appears on the increase (EIA 2012). In China, that holds the largest Snow Leopard population, trade in Snow Leopard pelt and bones, which was earlier restricted to Snow Leopard range provinces, is reported to also be emerging in the wealthier coastal cities since 2010 (Li and Lu 2014). The extent of illegal trade was reviewed by Maheshwari and Von Meibom (2016).",Terrestrial,"Very significant investments in conservation have been made. These include: establishment of new protected areas within the Snow Leopard range; anti-poaching measures; training and capacity-building; initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g. strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides), community engagement programmes; illegalization and confiscation of firearms across China, and education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its habitat (see Conservation Measures section for more details and examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008 (Sanderson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the revised version of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) have all enhanced the global strategic framework for conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Illegal poaching, the main threat to Russia's Snow Leopard population, was recently alleviated, at least in several important areas, by concerted removal of wire-snares and the recruitment of former poachers as protected area rangers (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Anti-poaching efforts in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have also been strengthened, thus addressing the main underlying threat that led to the drastic decline in numbers in several Central Asia states following the break-up of the Soviet Union 25 years ago.<br/><br/>In terms of protected area establishment and enhancement, the whole of Wakhan District Afghanistan (&gt;10,000 km²) has been declared the country’s second national park (Moheb and Paley 2016). Sarychat Ertash State Reserve, a key site in Kyrgyzstan, has recently been enlarged by 150 km² and mining concessions withdrawn (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015), and several projects have worked on management planning, training and monitoring and/ or provided substantial amounts of equipment (Hotham <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Tost Uul, a key site in Mongolia’s South Gobi, was declared a local nature reserve in 2010 (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a>, 4 October 2015). Capacity building in Zorkul State Reserve in the Eastern Pamir of Tajikistan includes development of a new management plan, training programmes, and substantial donations of equipment (Mallon and Diment 2013). The role of Buddhist monasteries in providing effective protection around monasteries was highlighted by Li <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2014). The GSLEP initiative, along with conservation practitioners have been highlighting customary beliefs of Snow Leopards as important totem animals for select traditional communities across this species' range.<br/><br/>A number of transboundary projects provide important conservation benefits to Snow Leopards across their range (Rosen and Zahler 2016). Two transboundary or landscape-level projects are currently operating in Central Asia (Mallon and Kulikov 2015): The Khan Tengri nature conservation park (3,257 km²) has been designated in eastern Kyrgyzstan that will link Naryn Reserve, Sarychat Ertash Reserve, and two others in Kyrgyzstan with Tomur Nature Reserve in China; a transboundary project is currently operating in the northern Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan) with Snow Leopard as a focal species and with the aim of developing cooperation and enhancing protected areas. The UNDP/GEF Altai-Sayan Project (2007-2012) also identified the Snow Leopard as one of its focal species and carried out a series of transboundary projects including camera trapping, and training (WWF 2012).<br/><br/>Many incentive programs have been initiated (reviewed in Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003 and see chapters in McCarthy and Mallon 2016). One oft-cited threat is the killing of Snow Leopards by herders in retaliation for predation on livestock, exacerbated by occasions when many sheep or goats are killed in a single attack by a Snow Leopard gaining entry to poorly constructed or maintained night-time corrals. Remedial measures have involved strengthening corrals to make them predator-proof. To date, over 260 corrals have been strengthened in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Tajikistan with the result that no subsequent livestock predation occurred (Mohammad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moheb and Paley 2016). A similar programme in Western Tyva, Russia protected corrals in 46 herder camps, and since 2008 no predation occurred in any of them and annual losses of livestock fell by 50-60% (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Innovative community programmes have been established in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with new governance structures created (over 65 in Pakistan) aimed at local natural resource management, and with over 50 rangers in the Afghan Wakhan and over 100 rangers in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan monitoring wildlife and enforcing local and national regulations against poaching and other resource extraction activities (Zahler and Paley 2016). A programme has been pioneered by the Snow Leopard Trust in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to increase local incomes by providing training in the manufacture of handicrafts and access for the finished products to international markets in return for a commitment to prevent poaching of Snow Leopards and their prey and to engage in environmental education and other activities. These programmes have proved successful and have had additional benefits (Bayarjargal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). In Kyrgyzstan, no Snow Leopards or prey were poached during 2014 in any of the partner communities (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015). Incentives related to ecotourism have led to a surge in Snow Leopard sightings in Hemis National Park, Ladakh (India), attributed to a combination of corral predator-proofing and meaningful income generation associated with community-managed homestays first initiated in 2007 (Jackson and Wangchuk 2004, Wangchuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Jackson 2015, Namgail and Dadul 2016). With these local communities now perceiving Snow Leopards positively instead of pests to be killed or chased away, this notoriously elusive big cat is now being regularly observed from distances as close as 50-200 meters, especially during its mating season in winter.<br/><br/>In addition to these programmes, other conservation initiatives include grazing set-asides (village reserves; Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock vaccination (Nawaz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock insurance (Kunkel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016) and a range of education and awareness projects (Hillard <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Conservation initiatives that blend conservation science with traditional knowledge, and which mitigate Snow Leopard-related human-wildlife conflict, improve household incomes for households dependent upon livestock, and that highlight the cultural and ecological importance of Snow Leopards are also most likely to be embraced by local people who likely represent the effective and cost-efficient stewards for this felid's remote mountain landscapes (Jackson and Brewer-Lama 2016).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

These vary in severity between regions, and in some areas considerably exceed the threshold for Vulnerable. In the last three generations (taken to be 24–30 years), declines in mainland South-east Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia), Bangladesh, and possibly Borneo and Sumatra have exceeded 50%, probably by a substantial margin. Despite this Sambar remains common in some localized logged, unprotected areas on Borneo, such as the Hose Mountains of Sarawak (where a national park is proposed but not yet enforced), but only where human access is difficult. The overall decline rate in India has been less, given the presence of large populations in a fair number of well-secured protected areas which have probably remained stable, but a decline rate averaging 30% is reasonable in India outside these areas (i.e. in the less effective protected areas and outside the protected areas network), and in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The situation in China is unclear as in some areas, for example Hainan, population recovery may be occurring, whilst major declines in other regions may have taken place prior to the 24–30 year assessment window; the population on Taiwan appears to be relatively stable. Although declines seem to be reversing very locally in a few sites, these numbers are a very small proportion of the whole population. There is no indication that declines will, at the species level, slow until populations are extinguished outside well-secured protected areas, which currently comprise only a small proportion of protected areas holding the species. Current trends of wild meat and antler marketing in South-east Asia and China suggest declines have probably sped up in some areas especially Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Since the 2008 assessment trends in wildlife exploitation and natural habitat conversion in mainland Southeast Asia, have if anything increased, thus although the relative size of the Southeast Asian population subcomponent has probably decreased compared with that in South Asia, the rate of decline has probably increased. The global population trend is still considered to be a decline somewhere between 30 and 50 % over three generations, for the past, present and future.&#160;The fact that Sambar is at least locally common in a number of high profile protected areas, such as Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and Cat Tien National Park, Viet Nam, and is commonly kept captive and proliferates in menageries in the region, was probably a significant factor in the failure to recognize the plight of the species prior to the 2008 reassessment. These same factors no doubt still to some degree cloud the issue.","No large Indian ungulate has adapted itself to a wider variety of forest types and environmental conditions than has Sambar (Schaller 1967). Within India, Sambar occurs in the thorn and arid forests of Gujarat and Rajasthan, in the moist and dry deciduous forests throughout peninsular India, in the pine and oak forests at the Himalayan foothills, and in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests of northeastern India and the Western Ghats (Sankar and Acharya 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Outside India it extends into temperate-latitude and alpine-zone woodlands of Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). This habitat flexibility is permitted by its broad diet: Sambar has been documented to eat 130–180 species of plants in India alone (Schaller 1967, Johnsingh and Sankar 1991, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), with food requirements less specialised than those of other deer (Schaller 1967). Sambar grazes or browses depending upon the forage available at that time (Schaller 1967, Richardson 1972, Martin 1977, Bentley 1978, Dinerstein 1979, Kelton and Skipworth 1987, Ngampongsai 1987, Sankar 1994, Semiadi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Across the very wide altitudinal range occupied in Taiwan, the diet varies reflecting major changes in plant communities (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). Sambar was found to live in much higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests of Nagarahole National Park (Karanth and Sunquist 1992) and there are no doubt also patterns of habitat selection across the rest of its range. Although the highest densities of Sambar so far recorded were in the semi-arid forests of Ranthambore (Kumar 2000), across most of its Indian range Sambar seems to thrive best in well-watered, moist deciduous hilly terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The Sambar occurs up to at least 3,825 m on Siouguluan Mountain, the highest peak of the Central Mountains in Taiwan; elsewhere on the island it ranges down to 150 m asl, mostly living at 2,000–3,500 m (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). It occurs up to 3,000 m on Gunung Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). In Myanmar, recent camera-trap photographs spanned the range of 0–2,150 m asl (Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is largely restricted to hilly terrain in the Terai Arc Landscape (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), although how much this reflects real habitat selection and how much it is an artificial pattern produced by human effects (habitat conversion and hunting) is unclear. More widely in India, there does seem to be a marked preference for undulating terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar usage was greater of the higher than the lower altitude area. However, it makes wide use of plains areas elsewhere, where these have not been destroyed, e.g. the Hukaung Valley in Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008).In Borneo, while Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) considered Sambar “most common in secondary forests of gently-sloping terrain” they also knew of occurrence in “tall dipterocarp forests on steep terrain and in swamp forests”. In Thung Yai, Thailand, Sambar signs were twice as abundant in lowland forest as in montane forest, although this difference was not statistically significant (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Across seven sites in Thailand, places where sambar was detected had shallower slopes, more open habitat, were closer to streams, closer to roads and villages, and had lower rainfall (Lynam <em>et al. </em>2012).In Southeast Asian regions of dense evergreen closed-canopy forest, Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978, Heydon 1994, Stuebing 1995, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Sabah, Sambar was camera-trapped in both mature and young forest stands (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). All the remaining Lao populations are centred around areas with extensive open, or at least broken, habitat amid forest (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), and the general paucity of records from the interiors of large blocks of closed-canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, which generally support the least depleted large mammal populations, probably reflects natural patterns of habitat occupation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Similarly, in extensive tracts of deciduous dipterocarp forest the species occurs primarily around patches of denser habitats, and this seems to be a natural rather than hunting-led pattern (Timmins and Ou 2001). In this sense, in Indochina Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em> is much more tolerant and versatile than is Sambar. In southern and central India where much of the forest is deciduous, Sambar is a true forest ungulate and conspicuously avoids disturbed and open forests, and is highly sensitive to any sort of forest resource extractive activities (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar was primarily in areas of high tree and herb density with low shrub density. O'Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) found no statistically significant difference in Sambar abundance between areas within 1 km inside the boundary of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, and those deep in the interior of the park. Caution is needed in inferring that there is truly no association of Sumatran Sambar with forest edges (which would be astonishing by comparison with its habitat use elsewhere) because the study does not specify whether this ‘non-significant’ result might simply reflect methodological factors rather than a genuine lack of biological effect (see, e.g., Johnson 1999). Despite the population rises that occur in post-logging forest, there is no evidence that Sambar can survive landscape-level conversion to exotic plantations or other non-forest land-uses, although many live in coconut plantations (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and it is relatively common in immature <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations within the matrix of plantation and natural forest of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu (B. Giman pers. comm. 2008).&#160;Camera trapping in oil palm plantations adjacent to Danum Valley in Sabah suggest that the species does not utilize plantations (Yue and J. Brodie unpublished data).A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Sambar only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007). In forest protected areas of Thailand such as Khao Yai National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Sambar populations are often concentrated around anthropogenic grass and scrub (e.g. sites of former villages) rather than in the forest itself (Trisurat <em>et al</em>. 1996; Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and this also seems to be true on remote parts of the Bolaven Plateau of south Lao PDR (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Annamite mountains of Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Sambar seems often to be associated with degraded valley bottom areas, largely the result of long human influence: although the effects of a permanent water source and differences in terrain in determining distribution are difficult to disentangle (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar regularly visits salt licks (e.g. Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2007), perhaps especially when growing new antlers. This predictability exposes it to high levels of hunting, where this is not effectively controlled. It seems that within an area, not all sort of licks are visited. At the Seima Biodivesity Conservation Area, Cambodia, Sambar photographs were initially very few at mineral lick camera-traps. But in 2007, cameras placed on trails and at some permanent water sources (especially in semi-evergreen forest) recorded Sambar much more often. Checking tracks at more than 40 licks indicated that some were used by Sambar and Red Muntjac, but not Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> or Asian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em>, while the big ones with many cattle and elephant prints had few Sambar prints (E. Pollard pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar was considered to be mostly nocturnal by Kawanishi and Sunquist (2004), to show ‘no pattern’ (meaning unclear; perhaps intended to imply no significant variation through the 24-hour cycle, although this is itself a pattern) by O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003), and to be cathemeral by van Schaik and Griffiths (1996). In fact, its activity pattern may vary across sites, but in general it is mostly crepuscular, with significant nocturnal activity as well (Schaller 1967; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is essentially non-social, stable groups being at most family associations (Schaller 1967; Karanth and Sunquist 1992). However, it is often in groups, presumably temporary, of 12–30 in dry deciduous and semi-arid forests of India (e.g. Bandipur, Pench, Melghat and Ranthambore) (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and the same is true around the secondary grasslands within Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). During peak summer, such associations of up to 80–100 near large waterbodies are not uncommon in Pench in central India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A detailed review of information on grouping in Sambar is in Sankar and Acharya (2004). Results from many areas show a strong bias in sex ratio to females, perhaps reflecting selective predation; alternatively, stags may be more vulnerable to stress (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Breeding is rather seasonal in most areas where studied, for example Schaller (1967) reported that in Kanha the rut spreads over a period of at least seven months with a peak in November–December. Stags during the rut sometimes can cover large distances, up to 10–20 km in one night. Further information for India is reviewed in Sankar and Acharya (2004). The bucks of Formosan Sambar have a seasonal antler cycle, and the mating season is from June to January with a peak in September–October. Males wallow and mark with scent glands in this season. Fawns are born (usually singly) from March to August, with a peak in May and June (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Predation appears to be the major cause of Sambar mortality. In Bandipur, Sambar is one of the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (31%), Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> (8%) and Dhole <em>C. alpinus</em> (13%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur Sambar remains were found in about 22.3% of Tiger faeces, 6.1% of Leopard faeces and 7.3% of Dhole faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, proportion of Sambar in Tiger’s diet was about 25–29%, derived from faeces and kill data respectively (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Sambar together with Gaur contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). Sambar occurred in 50% of Tiger scats in Pench-Maharashtra (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Sambar together with Gaur are selectively predated by Tiger.","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread in the Sundaic region and in much of the rest of Sambar’s range. Indeed, these two threats are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the range of Sambar, within which it is heavily hunted (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Tilson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). It is among the most sought-after wild meats in Indonesia (Semiadi 2005), Sarawak (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), and Viet Nam (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and during 1988–1993 it was a common and preferred food in rural Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Table 1), and is probably near the top of chosen wild meats throughout most of its range (GMA Indonesia workshop); however, it is less favoured in Taiwan compared with Formosan Serow <em>Capricornis crispus</em> and Reeves’s Muntjac <em>Muntiacus reevesi</em> (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). However, it is now so rare in Nam Ha National Protected Area, Lao PDR, that a more recent hunting study found it to be eaten only rarely (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Viet Nam, muntjac meat is now often served in wildlife restaurants as Sambar, because real Sambar meat is now so difficult to procure (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These declines in consumption are probably representative of all Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and of increasing proportions of the rest its range, reflecting population losses (see Population).<br/><br/>There are major, ongoing, declines in at least Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, and probably Sri Lanka and Indonesia (see Populations) which can plausibly only be driven by hunting, because suitable habitat for Sambar is abundant in these countries but is almost or actually bereft of the species. Even in India, poaching has seriously depleted the abundance of large mammals in most areas; even in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park there are still some instances of poaching (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting; Sambar fell in the second tier (aside, e.g., big cats <em>Panthera</em>) in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). This study found that Sambar persisted anomalously long in one place under an “exceptional village wildlife hunting regulation promulgated by the village headman until 1994”, but was generally extinct in the landscape. A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site, but found no significant difference in Sambar densities between the two areas (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). This was speculated to reflect the greater difficulty of hunting Sambar (highly dispersed and usually in rather thick vegetation), despite it being a prized species, than, particularly, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, a herding species often out in the open, and the benefit to poachers of getting in, making a kill, and getting back out again as fast as possible to reduce detection chances; therefore, this pattern seems to have arisen through hunter choice. In the context of Indochina, even the heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visit and discussion). For these two reasons, their finding, of an apparent high resilience of Sambar to hunting, is not applicable to the rest of the species' range (particularly outside well-secured protected areas). However, somewhat reflecting this, Sambar’s status in non-Sundaic South-east Asia (still widespread but in ongoing steep decline) relative to other large deer ecologically more similar to Chital (herding; often outside dense forest), Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> (extinct across most of their former range through former steep declines) does indeed suggest a broad applicability of a conclusion that Sambar is somewhat less rapidly reduced by hunting than are other sympatric deer, excepting muntjacs <em>Munitacus</em> spp.<br/><br/>Deer are hunted in India using snares, dogs, and guns (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003; Kumara and Singh 2004) and these methods are general across their range. Some hunting is for village consumption of meat, but most (at least in South-east Asia) is probably sold commercially, to the affluent urban classes (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Kumara and Singh 2004), and to itinerant labourers, such as logging crews in at least Sarawak (Bennett and Gunal 2001) and gold-diggers and rattan-cutters in Myanmar (in Myanmar (<span lang=""EN-US"">A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014 based on observations in 2002,&#160;J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Such commercially-driven hunting causes major declines (e.g. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008) because the market is limitless. Adult males suffer additionally because antlers are widely displayed as trophies and are used in traditional medicine (e.g. Martin 1992, Baird 1995). At least in Lao PDR, their market value means that, compared with muntjacs, a high proportion is sent to towns and traded internationally, and many are sold openly in tourist centres such as Louangphabang (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Taiwan, in the past live males were sought for farming velvet; this was far more valuable than the meat. Presently, velvet can be bought legally and cheaply from farms and hunting for velvet is now insignificant, as is, here, hunting for internal organs (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). Hunting pressures and patterns vary across Sambar’s range: three areas (Indochina; Malaysian Borneo; Taiwan) are profiled below, and all are very different not just from each other, but from southern and central India, where (excepting Taiwan) the species has by far the healthiest conservation status. But even across India, hunting for Sambar meat is almost ubiquitous, even occurring within well-secured protected areas, and to greater extents in other protected areas and outside the protected area system (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas of Sambar’s range where generalised mammal hunting is heaviest. Sambar is hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001, Smith and Xie Yan in press). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. However, the ability of these areas to protect Sambar at the regional scale is questionable, because no areas of rugged evergreen forest are known with high Sambar densities: such habitat is rather marginal. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any of the most resilient species (pigs, muntjacs, and civets) to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 84 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing Sambar set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km<sup>2</sup> per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004 ), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing,&#160;as suggested by a recent survey of forest in Dak Nong Province which detected Sambar only once and found many indications of extremely high hunting pressure (Timmins in press).&#160;Rapid economic development and expanding wealth, particularly Southeast Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (e.g. TRAFFIC&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss: as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates in Indochina, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species (Sambar included) is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, directly accelerated by illegal trade in timber, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 through Lao PDR (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years (up to 2008) and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat; at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried deer meat daily. The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2008). The most significant constraint to Indochina’s Sambar populations is the long-term uncertainty of success in protected areas, even in those currently effective in conservation management. Even the most successful protected areas face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the lack of, or possible future loss of, adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the lack of, or possible future loss of, political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff.<br/><br/>On Borneo, Sambar is also widely and heavily hunted, largely for meat consumed in-country (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunters used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) and Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: Sambar (along with Bearded Hog <em>Sus barbatus</em> and muntjacs <em>Muntiacus</em>) is heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants; Sambar in particular is an important source of meat for logging company employees in Sarawak. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 1,500 Sambars were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon Sambar through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Sambar constituted only 6.7% of animals killed in Sabah, but 35% by weight of wild meat; negligible numbers were taken in Sarawak, reflecting the major declines that had already reduced the species to rarity. Index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. There were, then, no official controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species. The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001).&#160;Substantial numbers of Sambars are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo. Although locally selective logging has probably benefited Sambar populations in some areas by creating more favourable habitats (e.g. Brodie in press b, c), and potentially increasing carrying capacity, the indirect effects of logging undoubtedly greately outweighs any potential benefit (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Moreover, in the interim since the Master Plan, much forest has been completely lost and Sambar populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be even more vulnerable to local extinctions. For most Sambar populations inaccessibility is still essentially the only real protection for the species, and there are few inaccessible areas left (J. Brodie in litt 2014).<br/><br/><p> </p>  <p>In a study area of almost half a million hectares in Sarawak Sambar detection probability declined by almost 40% between 2008-2014 (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014). This apparent decline coincided in part with harvesting of <em>Acacia mangium</em> although as of 2014 harvesting activity had only affected a few plantation compartments.&#160;The decline was also attributed to uncontrolled illegal hunting; prior to harvesting few people were involved in plantation activity, but for the period 2012-2014 many workers were brought in, and this resulted in many people hunting on a nightly basis. Additionally the harvesting activity destroyed an important mineral lick (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).</p><p><br/></p><p>Taiwan contrasts with the rest of Sambar range in that hunting has been so successfully reduced that populations are now increasing in large parts of the island. It was formerly a big problem, for venison and, for medicinal purposes, velvet and penis. The reduction during and since the 1990s reflects five factors. Hunting of Sambar was banned in 1989 through the Wildlife Conservation Act. Velvet prices fell steeply during 1985–1990 with deer TB in 1985, reducing returns from poaching absolutely an effect exacerbated by rapid economic development in 1980s leading to higher daily wages. Former logging road systems are deteriorating within protected areas, making removal of deer meat less attractive. The general awareness of ecological conservation has much enhanced. And eco-tourism through community forestry plans has given alternative employment to former hunters (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> Other sympatric ungulates are hunted broadly as avidly as Sambar, but there is suggestive evidence from two areas of Thailand (Kuiburi National Park and a 20 km² sector of Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary) that when Sambar densities are very much reduced, recovery may be more difficult than with Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> and muntjacs. In both these areas the institution of effective protection fuelled a rise in sign density, and presumably animal populations, for Gaur and muntjacs, but not for Sambar (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario may be ongoing in eastern Cambodia, where Sambar numbers are extremely low (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011), presumably because of targeted hunting; yet despite the instigation of protection measures which up to at least 2008 appeared to have moderated hunting pressure there has been no visible sign of recovery (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). But currently significant levels of hunting still exist and have probably been increasing recently, due both to changes in the dynamics of poaching and to some extent protected area management (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014), and perhaps this could be a significant factor in recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). &#160;If these finding are widely applicable the implications for Sambar populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, northern Thailand, Peninsula Malaysia, Sarawak and other areas where populations are mostly down to scattered tiny numbers, may be profound.</p><p><br/></p> Over many centuries, the loss of wilderness to human settlement, cultivation and industry has resulted in massive loss of potential Sambar range, particularly in the densely-settled countries of India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Throughout the range of Sambar, natural and semi-natural habitats (forest, shrubland and grassland) continue to be converted to anthropogenic habitats, degraded (e.g. stands are being changed in character through logging) and fragmented (broken into smaller blocks). The relative proportions of these activities vary across the range as does the percentage of former forest land so affected. The role of these habitat changes as a direct stimulant of the major declines in progress is unclear. Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine closed-canopy forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978; Heydon 1994; Stuebing 1995; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001, Brodie <em>et al. </em>in press b, c). Degradation <em>per se</em> is unlikely to be a significant threat. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Sambar populations warrant further study. There is no evidence that Sambar can survive complete conversion of landscapes to non-forest uses such as rice paddies, and its ability to use tree plantations in the absence of natural forest is unclear. Probably, like most deer, provided strips of semi-natural vegetation survive (e.g. along streams and on steep slopes) are present, it can use them to some degree. In most of its range (parts of India excepted) it is unlikely that habitat extent is the determining factor of current Sambar numbers, because large tracts of apparently suitable habitat now support no or only tiny numbers of Sambar. By far the most serious effect of current habitat trends is that fragmentation opens up wilderness areas to people, making it easier to hunt throughout them and cheaper to remove bulk wildlife products such as Sambar meat. In both Malaysian Borneo and Lao PDR the ‘natural protection’ afforded to an area through difficulty of access has been considered to be the chief factor allowing populations of large, hunted, mammals to survive (Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000), and this is probably widely true for Sambar outside India, Nepal and the few other areas where active protective measures are effective. Although Sambar has a wide tolerance of habitat types, numerous observations and studies have indicated that highest densities and presumably habitat preferences of the species correlate with factors such as relatively gentle terrain, river plains, stream and other wetland vicinities, habitat ecotones, and secondary formations originating from closed canopy forests (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2014; Lynam<em> et al.</em> 2012, Brodie<em> et al.</em> in press b, c), all factors which correlate positively with ongoing anthropogenic pressures and thus suggest that optimal habitats (and thus potentially a significant proportion of the global Sambar population) are correlated in one way or another with high threat levels for the species. &#160;In sum, the proximate cause of the major ongoing Sambar declines in most of its range is hunting, for which habitat conversion and fragmentation exacerbate the effects; and these processes are resulting in an ever-smaller maximum possible population, were the hunting issues to be successfully addressed.<br/> <br/> Threats other than hunting and, locally, habitat loss, seem to be insignificant at the species level. Hybridization with Javan Rusa <em>Rusa timorensis</em> has been documented (Van Mourik and Schurig 1985), and is apparently a localized threat, where the latter has been introduced into Sambar range, in Pewajam District, East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006) and potentially more widely (Corlett 2010). Hybridization has also been suspected in Sumatra, with the introduced Chital <em>Axis axis</em> (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006). However, Sambar and Chital co-occur extensively in India without hybridizing. Sambar is an occasional crop pest in mainland China, notably around the Ailoshan range (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008), India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008), Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008), and probably throughout its range. There is no evidence that Sambar is a serious crop pest away from the fields directly abutting forests. Nonetheless, crop damage is often stated by affected farmers to lead to a requirement for lethal control. However, the ready market for meat means that this is most probably an excuse for killing that would enthusiastically be undertaken anyway (N.S. Kumar and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008): it is therefore unlikely that control of crop-degrading animals is a significant cause of the species' decline anywhere in Sambar’s range. Grazing competition with domestic stock seems to be much less of a threat to Sambar than to sympatric Gaur and Chital: in fact the key study quantifying just how serious a threat such competition is in Indian protected areas (Madhusudan 2004) found that it had negligible effects on Sambar densities, presumably because Sambar is an efficient browser. Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). In the Indian Terai Arc Landscape, lopping of tree branches for cattle fodder is a threat to Sambar as it effectively removes most browsable vegetation from the landscape (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These are probably more serious concerns for Sambar than is grazing by domestic stock.</span>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Almost everywhere outside Taiwan and <span lang=""EN-GB"">well-managed protected areas<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">in India, the Sambar is in rapid decline, which has lead to very low numbers and many local-level extinctions over a wide area. The occasional healthy populations reflecting special circumstances. Few surveys specifically target Sambar, but a reasonable picture of its current status is emerging through surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris </em>and through general wildlife surveys. Tiger-oriented camera-trapping predictably yields photographs of Sambar when it is present, and most Tiger surveys afford priority to elucidating Sambar status as a key prey, and therefore population determinant, of Tiger. Understanding Sambar status through surveys of Tigers or, sometimes, of Leopard <em>P. pardus </em>(e.g. Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2007) needs care, because such surveys have generally selected the best remaining areas for very large mammals within the country or region in question, so as to maximize chances of picking up Tigers. They therefore cannot be seen as indicative of Sambar status in the wider landscape. Most importantly, in the several cases (identified below) where such surveys have found few Sambar, these indicate cause for alarm, because there is little reason to believe that there ought to be larger populations in many other areas in the country or region in question, even though large parts of it may remain unsurveyed. Occasional herds can survive in unexpected places through atypical site-specific circumstances in some countries (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Populations outside the native range are not treated here, as they are irrelevant to assigning the Red List Category and Criteria.</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Sri Lanka, numbers have probably declined substantially through poaching which increased during the civil war. Poaching occurred widely across the country, including within protected areas, particularly where there are concentrations of resettled refugees (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/> <br/> In India, although the Sambar occurs widely and in many habitat types, and large populations occur in well-secured protected areas, nowhere is it now regionally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004); although see below. It has been recorded in 208 protected areas (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India, cited in Sankar and Acharya 2004); its distribution outside protected areas is now generally highly scattered. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Sambar status is best in the three southern Indian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Most protected areas (tiger reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries) in these states appear to have stable or even increasing Sambar local populations and they are easily one of the most common ungulates encountered in protected areas (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Protected areas in Karnataka in particular have high densities of Sambar&#160; (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Hunting and poaching has been more problematic in areas of Kerala, but it also has some very well protected areas and there is also constant in-migration from protected areas outside of Kerala, this is especially so in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve area (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. The situation outside&#160;protected areas&#160;in the three southern states is however often very different and “mostly in the red”, but there are a few exceptions, like the Valparai Plateau in Tamil Nadu where Sambar is very common, and can be found on private lands (Sridhar <em>et al. </em>2008, N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. In the southern Western Ghats in particular and some parts to the north of this, there has been no noticeable decline in Sambar distribution in the last twenty years (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). However there are indications, based on interview data that abundance has been declining in the Western Ghats (Pillay<em> et al.</em> 2011). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">In other central and east Indian states Sambar is “very rare”, “extremely patchy and in severe decline” “owing to severe hunting pressures, insurgency, rapidly spreading mines (both bauxite and iron-ore)” (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <br/></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The reported ecological densities of Sambar in India mostly fall within 1–10 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;within the protected area network, and depending on the varying levels of protection efficacy: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 0.89 +/- 0.23 (SE) per km<sup>2</sup> (Jathanna <em>et al.</em> 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 9.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 1.5 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 5.5 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 5.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Melghat dry deciduous forest, 2.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.9 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 10.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, two animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan et al. 1996). Similar surveys at Kaziranga found too few Sambar to estimate populations there (Karanth and Nichols 2000), this presumably representing habitat characters rather than defective protection, given the buoyant populations of other deer at that site (Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and forest-resource extraction (Jathanna <em>et al. </em>2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data as of 2008).<span lang=""EN-GB""> Local population trends in well protected reserves appear to be stable and even increasing in areas recently freed from anthropogenic pressures (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. But in poorly protected reserved forests subject to hunting and heavy cattle grazing, Sambar density seems to be extremely low; certainly too low to permit actual estimation of density (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">Outside protected areas, Sambar is present mostly in very low numbers, although larger numbers can still be found where its habitat is almost inaccessible to people (Anonymous 2008).<br/> <br/> Nepal supports an important population in Bardia National Park (Dinerstein 1979). This remains healthy and there are also good populations in Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve. Across the country Sambar has declined so rapidly and so widely that it is now very rare outside protected areas, mostly recorded as isolated reports from forests adjoining these protected areas, and from south-east Nepal. Sambar has been victim of poachers, probably because of its large size (thus, more meat per animal and, for males, a more impressive trophy), perhaps compounded by nocturnal and relatively docile nature; recent declines are of the magnitude to meet IUCN criteria for Vulnerable on a national assessment (all information: Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). It is unclear whether the demand for antler in velvet in eastern Asia is stimulating poaching in Nepal.<br/> <br/> No information concerning current status was traced from Bhutan but (simply on an area basis) numbers are unlikely to be large enough to influence the overall global population trend.<br/> <br/> In Bangladesh, the Sambar was common in the north-east, south-east and hill-tract forests in the 1960s (Khan 1985) but now is restricted to the forest fragments of the southeast, mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar occurrence in protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and eco parks) is now doubtful and all recent records and reports have come from outside protected areas from areas that were largely inaccessible to the majority of people prior to 1997 due to insurgency (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar was detected by camera-trapping at 22 of 38 surveyed grid cells (each &gt;50% forest cover&#160; and 10,000 ha) in the CHT during 2010-2011, but it was assumed that outside the survey area, Sambar was either absent or occurred in very low numbers (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Within the best two grid cells (rated in terms of forest cover, inaccessibility and presence of Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>) detection rate of Sambar was 2.07 independent photos/100 camera trap nights. Following the signing of a peace accord between the Bangladesh Government and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (the political organization of CHT indigenous people) both the rate of habitat loss and hunting pressure have been accelerating in the period after 1997 (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). There is no sign of significant change in either factor in near future and if current habitat loss and hunting rates continue indefinitely extirpation of sambar is likely within the next 30 years (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""> In China there were major declines in Sambar over much of the twentieth century, and populations probably decreased by more than 50% in the 30 years from 1978 to 2008; records from Guangxi suggest that, there at least, the 1970s–1980s was the era of fastest decline (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008; B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). In some provinces populations seem now to have stabilized, and in some areas, particularly in Hainan (where several apparently stabilised populations are present, but all are small, reflecting habitat patch size: the largest may be of only a few hundred animals) and north Guangdong province (perhaps also the east of that province, where there is a nature reserve specifically for the species), populations may even have been increasing once again in the last few years. This is not so for Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Yunnan (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Further north, in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan and Hubei, a multi-method Tiger survey in 2001 found that Sambar is very rare overall and scattered in present-day distribution (Tilson <em>et al.</em> 2004). For elsewhere in China, Smith and Xie Yan (2008) mapped wide presence in Sichuan, plus isolated populations in the provinces of Qinghai, Tibet, Chongqing, and Fujian. The original sources are not clear, and R. Harris (pers. comm.) doubts that Sambar has lived anywhere in Qinghai in recent times. <br/> <br/> In Taiwan, numbers and geographic distribution reduced rapidly through hunting before 1987, then expanded somewhat since the mid 1990s reflecting reductions in hunting. The average population density in the Yu-Li Wildlife Refuge was 10.6 animals per km² in 2005. In some areas at high altitude, densities exceed 40 animals per km², and the animals have a large impact on the coniferous saplings in this area. But at low to mid altitude, hunting pressure remains high enough to restrain their distribution and density. Based on the known geographical distribution, there are five populations: A-Yu Mountain, Nanhu, Shei-Pa, Jade Mountains–Central Mountains, and Tawu. The A-Yu population was re-introduced (about 70 animals) by local deer farmers in 1988–1991, when the velvet price was very low through the impact of deer TB in 1985. This population has not expanded reflecting continuous poaching; it may be genetically polluted. The other four populations are all natural, assumed to be isolated by cross-island roads, and may have very low gene flows with each other. Sambar is largely restricted to protected areas, only occurring outside them in a few nearby areas. The population sizes and distributions in these areas are smaller than in the protected areas. The poaching pressure is an important limitation to Sambar in these unprotected areas (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Myanmar, Sambar was detected at 12 of 15 camera-trapped Tiger sites during 1999–2002, indicating that it was still widespread (Lynam 2003). Sambar meat and antlers were commonly found in local markets in the Hukaung Valley in 2002 (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014) indicating heavy hunting pressure, possibly partially explaining extremely low densities of tigers in the area at that time (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; The Myanmar Forest Department and Wildlife Conservation Society have since jointly (as of May 2008) camera-trapped 21 survey areas (including the earlier 15) and found Sambar in 13 (S. Htun pers. comm. 2008). This lower ratio of proven presence indicates how the areas selected for Tiger survey were above average for prey and may indicate increasing local-level extinctions. For example, in a multi-method study of one area not expected to hold Tiger, hunted animals showed that Sambar still occurred in Naungmung and Machanbaw (south of Hkakaborazi National Park, Kachin state), but it was so scarce that it was not detected by substantial amounts of either camera trapping or sign surveys (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005). Even within these best areas, large declines are suspected and overall national population losses of about 50% over the last 25–30 years and in the following such period are likely (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006; Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Thailand, several protected areas maintain big Sambar populations; these are mostly large with very few or no people living within them. Over much of the country Sambar is extinct or very nearly so, including in many protected areas, particularly in the north where most parks are small and heavily poached (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is rare in most areas of Thung Yai Naresuan, where commercial hunting has targeted large ungulates (Steinmetz <em>et al. </em>2008). Sambar was recorded at over 40% of camera-trap locations during a Leopard survey in Kaeng Krachan National Park, and clearly remains widespread there. Abundance did not vary with proximity to villages, even though a variety of hunting methods occurs on site (Ngoprasert et al. 2007). Sambar is also locally abundant in Khao Yai National Park, Thap Lan National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam et al. 2006), and the remote core zone of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). In Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary current Sambar density is about 2–3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and it seems to be increasing (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Lao PDR, Sambar was described as very common throughout the wooded parts by Delacour (1940). Some decades later, the species was reported during 86% of 1988–1993 village interviews (n = 328) and was then still widespread throughout, except in the most heavily settled areas (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999: Annex 5). However, sightings on surveys during 1992–1998 were very rare, and while calls heard by night and signs indicate a wide distribution, numbers are heavily depressed (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001). Only in Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA did Sambar seem at least locally abundant (Davidson 1998), and reasonable populations were confirmed still to persist in 2003–2004 (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004); an exceptional area in an Indochinese context, that still supported significant Tiger numbers in 2008 (Walston <em>et al. </em>2010). The Nakai Plateau and the mountainous interior of Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and a few other, localized, areas of Lao PDR, including the Dong Kalo tract of Xe Pian NPA, the Nam Hiang area of the Bolaven Plateau, and parts of Nam Kading NPA also seemed to support relatively high densities during the mid 1990s. The few sites resurveyed during 2004–2007 have in general shown major declines (e.g. Timmins and Robichaud 2005). There was not a single camera-trap photograph during fairly intensive camera-trapping in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA during 2006–2007, although the species has subsequently been found to persist in a few parts of the protected area (Johnson and Johnston 2007; W.G. Robichaud and Nam Theun Watershed Management Protection Authority pers. comm. 2008) and it is not clear whether quirks of camera-trap placement (e.g., hypothetically, a focus on slopes rather than valley bottoms) may have been a major contributor to the lack of photographs. The Nakai Plateau still supports noteworthy numbers in a Lao context, but even here there were signs of decline (Dersu 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014) and no Sambar were camera-trapped in Xe Sap NPA during relatively extensive camera-trapping (~40 sites, ~5,000 trap-nights) in 2012 and 2013 (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). Surprisingly, given the proximity to China and Viet Nam, a good population was found to persist in Phou Dendin NPA in the far north-east of Lao PDR in 2004–2005 (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). In sites surveyed since 2008 evidence for persistence has been found in most large forest blocks (e.g. &gt;50,000 ha), although nowhere common, but generally not in small and isolated fragments, while in many areas of the country evidence suggests increasing levels of hunting especially commercial scale snaring (SUFORD 2010, Duckworth in press, Duckworth et al. 2010, Timmins 2014, 2009, in press b, Woxvold 2009, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Viet Nam, in most of the northern highlands, in particular, and all other areas of Viet Nam to an increasing extent, Sambar is very rare or has been hunted out from many areas of otherwise suitable habitat (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999; Grieser Johns 2000; Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014; B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping studies in Pu Mat National Park, Thua Thien Hue province and Quang Nam province between 1998 and 2007 recorded only a handful of records and local communities in all these areas report a major decline in numbers (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Greater than 19,000 camera-trap nights from &gt;100 locations in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves detected the species from only one location (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). With so many higher-profile species long listed as threatened on the Red List, many of them with restricted ranges, the status of Sambar in Viet Nam has largely been ignored, and the paucity of evidence during many surveys has rarely been highlighted in reviews. As with many large mammals, populations were thought to be best in southern parts of the country, but even here hunting pressure is high in most remaining forest areas, and Sambar is thought to be scarce to extirpated in most remaining forest areas (a high proportion of which is within protected areas) (Timmins in press a, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). It was not considered at all common in surveys of several areas of prime habitat in Dak Lak Province in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997). In a three week survey of forest in western Dak Nong Province only a single Sambar was detected on the basis of signs, this despite the area being contiguous with Seima PF in Cambodia (Timmins in press a). It remains locally common in Cat Tien National Park (Polet and Ling 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), but this is very much the exception to the species status in almost all protected areas in Viet Nam (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, Sambar “appears to be at least relatively common in some areas, though entirely absent from others, a feature which appears to have a strong correlation to local hunting pressure. At the current rate of persecution, this species is likely to decline sharply over the next few years (Walston <em>et al.</em> 2001). During the 2008 assessment Sambar was considered “still widespread, although heavily targeted by hunters and most populations are now very depressed (Timmins and Men 1999, Timmins <em>et al. </em>2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, Timmins 2006)”. However substantial declines have certainly occurred since that time (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), as a result of increasing hunting pressure, especially in the east because of Vietnamese driven trade (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014, Timmins in press a), but elsewhere because of increasing ease of access to forest areas as a result of infrastructure development, settlement of frontier forest areas and agriculture and forestry concession developments (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). <span lang=""EN-GB"">In Seima PF, Phnom Prich WS, and Mondulkiri PF Sambar densities are considered too low to allow density and population estimation, although behaviour is also thought to contribute to the low detection rate on line transects there (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The population is almost certainly smaller even than that of wild oxen, and probably numbers in the low hundreds of animals (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). Sambar densities are low throughout the Eastern Plains (e.g. Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011; Timmins and Ou Ratanak 2001), almost certainly a result of targeted hunting in combination with the ecological association of Sambar with ‘edge’-type habitats and riparian corridors. <span lang=""EN-US"">In the eastern plains of Cambodia, where populations of many other ungulates were and still are magnitudes more numerous than in other areas of Indochina, Sambar numbers are clearly low, almost certainly as a result of targeted hunting: numbers in some areas seem depressed even well below those of wild cattle (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014;&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Gray <em>et al. </em>2013, 2011;&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins and Ou 2001). Protection activities in a few localised areas appeared initially to have stabilized declines up to c. 2008, but this was an exception to a general scenario of rapid decline, and now it appears that even in these reasonably well managed areas with significant resources input into protection and law enforcement activities that hunting pressure is rising in intensity, presumably largely because of the increasing lucrative nature of the trade in wildlife, rather than a decrease in protection efforts, augmented somewhat by the greater connectivity and better infrastructure connecting wildlife sources to markets (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, J. Khamler pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). These declines are evidently faster and more recent than in either Lao PDR or Viet Nam, reflecting the rapid pace of change of economic and logistical factors in Cambodia since the mid 1990s. Since the species' assessment in 2008 this rate of decline has almost certainly increased, perhaps even by an order of magnitude (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The primary reason for this increase has been the rapid economic growth that Cambodia has seen in the intervening period, particularly the rapid development of agro-industry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). This by itself would not necessarily lead to major declines in Sambar, but the infrastructural development associated with agricultural concessions has created easy access to huge areas of formerly relatively remote forest areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Even protected areas are not secure, with legal concessions granted within the former boundaries of even those with strong international support (T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2014). At the same time illegal exploitation of the rich natural resources of Cambodia has increased, as commodity values have increased, as access to these resources has increased and as regional cross-border natural resource trade networks have become stronger (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Recent studies have confirmed what was earlier suspected that Sambar populations even in some of the areas of best wildlife status are highly depressed, but more worryingly however there are no signs of a significant recovery in such areas and hunting pressure may in fact be increasing despite concerted resource investment in protected area management, particularly law enforcement strategies, from international NGOs (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2011; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; S. Brook pers. comm. 2014; J. Kamler pers. comm. 2014). Although the rates of decline have been increasing in Cambodia, concurrently as the numbers of animals remaining have decreased, the influence of the Cambodian population status on the global population trend has probably changed little (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> For a review of the species status in Peninsula Malaysia Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2014) considered that the rate of decline was sufficient to warrant an Endangered listing, i.e. a 50% or greater decline. This conclusion was based on several lines of evidence, most notably the results of camera-trapping surveys showing absence and or low densities in a majority of remaining forest areas, and rates of forest loss. Camera-trapping studies between 1998 and 2008 over more than 20,000 trap days, detected Sambar (68 photographs) in only 3 of 18 Permanent Reserved Forests, but detected the species in all five protected areas surveyed (346 photographs in c. 19,900 trap-days) (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">), however the species was only commonly detected (e.g. capture rate &gt;1/25 trap nights) in two PAs Taman Negara K Koh and Endau Rompin and one PRF Temenggor. Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) like the majority of the studies that formed part of the synthesis of <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>(2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">) was specifically aimed at Tigers and their prey, and hence camera-traps were set specifically with Sambar detection in mind, the results are thus particularly informative of Sambar status; during the study Sambar was photographed at only one of the nine areas surveyed during 1997–1999, Temenggor, where it was the most commonly photographed mammal (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In more recent studies from 2009 to 2013 totalling more than 40,000 trap days focused on three national priority tiger conservation landscapes Sambar was detected by camera-trapping in only four of ten forest units surveyed, with presence confirmed in another through observational surveys of signs, but was only commonly detected in one, Royal Belum State Park (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">). The high incidence of muntjac and pig pictures in both earlier and later periods of survey clearly indicate that the results are indicative of Sambar status rather than an issue with camera-trapping methodology. &#160;In the 1990s, Sambar was found in only one of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas) in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves, making it the most localized mammal species visually detected on forest transects (Laidlaw 2000, K. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 2014). The occupied site was a logged area (Laidlaw 2000). None was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006; one of the 23 studies assessed by <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Camera-trapping and sign-based survey studies in Taman Negara NP have independently corroborated declines in Sambar numbers between c. 2000 and 2010 (<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Crude density estimates based of photographic capture-recapture analysis of individually recognizable stags (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004) declined from 0.20 to 0.01 animals per km<sup>2</sup> while the occupancy estimate declined from 0.54 to 0.19 in Taman Negara.

Serious recent declines are also corroborated by an interview survey of hunters in which over 80% of 61 interviewees from throughout Peninsula Malaysia considered declines had occurred (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Goldthorpe and Neo 2011<span lang=""EN-US"">), and a decline in the number of hunting licences issued for Sambar (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi 2008,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

Brodie in litt. 2014). Sambar was found to be present but uncommon in the remaining areas of Mulu National Park (Sarawak), Pulong Tau National Park (Sarawak), the Ulu Padas region (Sabah), the Ulu Trusan region (Sarawak), and the Ulu Baram (Sarawak) (Brodie <em>et al.</em> in press, <span lang=""EN-US"">J.

Other populations previously reported to be in reasonable condition include those in <span lang=""EN-US"">Tabin Wildlife Reserve (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005), and Deramakot Forest Reserve (Matsubayashi <em>et al.</em> 2007) both in Sabah. Sambar has been extirpated or persists only at extremely low densities in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia (Azlan and Engkamat Lading 2006). An intensive survey of Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, found Sambar only once; this was stated to be a genuine reflection of actual rarity, and to result from intensive hunting at salt-licks (Meredith 1995). Across Sarawak and to a lesser extent Sabah it is seriously reduced by hunting (Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2000, see Threats; A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008), although persistence is probably still widespread (J. Brodie in litt. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""il""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In the Indonesian part of Borneo populations seem to be less depleted, particularly in East Kalimantan, which is believed to hold the largest Sambar populations among all Kalimantan provinces; in the Penajam Paser Utara district of East Kalimantan, approximately 60 hunted animals are sold monthly in several traditional markets (Semiadi <em>et al.</em> 2004, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></p><p>In Indonesia, there are various recent records from Sumatra, e.g. Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (O'Brien<em> </em><em>et al</em>. 2003), Gunung Leuser (van Schaik and Griffiths (1996), and Way Kambas National Park (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008), but in these areas it was recorded rather rarely by comparison with other ungulates. Sambar was nearly six times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting, and reduced populations overall (O'Brien&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003). In Way Kambas National Park the population is reportedly stable (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Overall in Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo), Sambar is not under major threat except where forest is being converted (i.e. most of the lowlands). Reflecting this, E. Pollard (pers. comm. 2008) considered the status of Sambar, in suitable habitat, to be much more healthy there than in Cambodia and Viet Nam, although there is a significant market for Sambar antlers in Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"The Sambar extends from India and Sri Lanka east along the southern Himalayas (including Nepal and Bhutan) through much of south China (including Hainan Island) to Taiwan (where it occurs in the central and eastern parts; Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comms. 2008). Further south it occurs in Bangladesh, throughout mainland Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam, West Malaysia) and many of the main islands of the Greater Sundas (excepting Java): Sumatra, Siberut, Sipora, Pagi and Nias islands (all Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei) (Grubb 2005). The current distribution is now highly fragmented in much of this range (see Population). Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) also listed the Philippines, but the Sambar does not occur there. A record from Ujung Kulon, Java, in van Schaik and Griffiths (1996: 107) is presumably an error for Javan Deer <em>R. timorensis</em>. The Sambar has been introduced widely outside its native range, e.g.: San Luis Obispo Country, California; the Gulf Prairies and Edwards Plateau regions of Texas (Ables and Ramsey 1974); the St. Vincent Islands, Franklin Country, Florida (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1990); Australia (Slee 1984, Freeland 1990); New Zealand (Kelton and Skipworth 1987); and Western Cape Province, South Africa (Lever 1985). These introduced populations are not included on the distribution map.","The Sambar is hunted for sport, food, medicinal products and other purposes. It is uncertain how many captive animals are kept within the native range, potentially larger herds occur in countries where introduced, and the comparative contributions of wild and captive sourced products to markets is unknown - the markets may be somewhat separate.",Terrestrial,"The Sambar is found in many protected areas throughout its range, although in most of these areas this legal status has not stemmed declines and local extinctions from hunting. Similarly, although it is protected from hunting by legislation, even outside protected areas, in most or all range states, these laws are challenging to enforce, given the trade demand for meat and antlers (GMA Indonesia Workshop).&#160;In Sarawak, Borneo, unfortunately,&#160;Sambar&#160;is not on the protected list of Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance, 1998 (a,b) (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Currently the law has a strong protective effect in Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008) and in various protected areas of India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, Sambar declines have lagged behind those of other sympatric deer (excepting muntjacs). There is no doubt that within a decade or two Sambar will be, like Hog Deer and Eld’s Deer are already, almost absent from South-east Asia unless effective protection from trade-driven hunting is instituted. In India the species’s status is less grim, and this is dependent upon continuation of the current protected areas system, and the expansion of effective threat reduction into a greater proportion of protected areas: in many Indian protected areas, poaching is rampant and in such vulnerable areas Sambar numbers are still declining. Given the major challenges combating hunting of such a desired animal, long-term survival is most realistic in large protected areas (exceeding 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> where possible), lacking people living within them, with an adequate number of motivated and capable staff (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008, A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). The precise ways for protected areas to function effectively in the conservation of large mammals depend upon their own specific circumstances, but field presence of staff, dispersed across the area, is likely to be important in almost every area. For example, Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2006) found in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, that encounter rates of tracks and signs of Sambar (and other large mammals) decreased with distance from ranger substations. Deep inside the forest to the south and east, far away from ranger substations, Sambar was locally extinct. Similar patterns are shown by current Sambar distributions in other Thai protected areas such as Khao Sok, Phu Khieo and Kaeng Krachan (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Sambar (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Sambar populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that outmigration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai. Most of the remaining forest within its Chinese range are already established as nature reserves (M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Sambar population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Sambar presence through its historical range, to preserve Sambar genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region.<br/><br/><p>The most important conservation measure for Sambar in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, and in Thailand it is to to expand government-funded park protection and ranger training programmes outside of the few parks which are currently well supported in the Western Forest Complex. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Sambar conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Nam Et–Phou Louey, and Nakai–Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species, but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Sambar conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Sambar as the focus for efforts.<br/> <br/> Captive breeding is being developed in East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). A captive herd of 223 heads in 10 ha enclosure was established in 1998 in Penajam District, as a pilot project. Several private herds exist in the province, such as at Bearau and at Nunukan, both with more than 20 heads (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Captive Sambar herds are also widespread in mainland Asia.&#160;</p>",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

The range, based on maximal extent of plausibly occupied habitat as&#160;shown in this account's map,&#160;is calculated to be about 24,500 km<sup>2</sup>. Nilgiri Marten population density is not known, but given the generally very low sighting rates&#160;of this diurnal, distinctive (although there remains evidence of confusion in&#160;some claimed sightings with Indian Giant&#160;Squirrel <em>Ratufa indica</em>), and generally non-shy&#160;species, an average very low&#160;density is assumed. Assuming that half the calculated&#160;range is&#160;not occupied at all, and that the other half&#160;supports varying densities with large proportions of it holding only very low densities, an average of&#160;one animal per 8 km<sup>2</sup> is within the bounds of credibility. This&#160;would give a population of about 1,500. Assuming that about two-thirds of the pre-breeding population are mature individuals, this&#160;suggests about 1,000&#160;mature individuals - the threshold for Vulnerable categorisation under&#160;criterion&#160;D1.&#160;<br/><br/>It might be close to&#160;warranting categorisation as&#160;Vulnerable also&#160;under criterion C1. The global population estimate falls comfortably within the threshold under C for Endangered (fewer than 2,500 mature individuals), but it is not plausible that it is&#160;showing a&#160;20% decline in 14 years (two generations).&#160;Given the levels&#160;of persecution in parts of its range&#160;it is possible that it is&#160;in continuing decline, but it is unlikely that it is&#160;losing even 10% per 21 years, the level which would be needed for categorisation as&#160;Vulnerable. Should there be a change in land-use policy that would cause significant clearance of forest within its range, this conclusion would need to be reviewed.","Nilgiri Marten has been recorded mainly in evergreen forests and montane forest-grassland mosaics, with a few sight-records from moist deciduous forest very close to evergreen forest (Mudappa 1999, Yoganand and Kumar 1999, J. Joshua pers. comm. 2006, Sridhar <em>et al</em>. 2008, D.&#160;Mudappa&#160;pers. comm. 2014), as well as in some altered habitats such as tea, acacia, coffee and cardamom plantations, generally within three kilometres of forest&#160;(Schreiber <em>et al.</em> 1989, Yoganand and Kumar 1999, Jathanna 2010, Krishna and Karnad 2010, Anoop 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>This species will prey opportunistically on almost any small bird or mammal (Pocock 1941), including Indian Chevrotain <em>Moschiola indica</em>&#160;(Christopher and Jayson 1996, Kurup and Joseph 2001, Mudappa 2002), Indian Giant Squirrel <em>Ratufa indica</em> (Hutton 1949a, V. Ramachandran, pers. comm. 2014),&#160;and on Bengal Monitor lizard&#160;<em>Varanus bengalensis</em>&#160;(Mudappa 1999); it feeds also&#160;on nectar (Hutton 1944) and probes fallen logs (Kurup and Joseph 2001), probably for invertebrates or reptiles. While sightings in forest areas are rare, local forest-edge communities (local planters along the eastern border of Talacauvery and Padinalknad Reserved&#160;Forest&#160;to the south, the southern border of Pattighat RF and the southern/eastern border of Pushpagiri) usually know this distinctive species well and regularly sight Nilgiri Martens when they raid bee-boxes placed in coffee and cardamom plantations close to forest areas (reportedly to feed on the bee larvae, rather than honey), especially during November-January.","Although Nilgiri Marten is not often observed, there is a good understanding of general levels and trends in habitat and hunting across its range. On this basis, the only predictable threats are habitat conversion (for large development projects like roads and dams), persecution in retribution for its destruction of bees-box contents (particularly in Kodagu)&#160;and, potentially, increase in tourism. After sustained large-scale deforestation within Nilgiri Marten range around a century ago, rates have slowed considerably in recent decades. Large development projects have been destroying some habitat, and fragmenting what remains, at low rates for the last three generations (21 years); these rates are not expected to rise significantly in the next 21 years. With increasingly effective legal protection, hunting currently is not a major issue for the survival of the species in most of its range. This hunting was largely an attempt to reduce the loss of bees-box contents (and consequent honey production); a few decades&#160;ago, there were even bounties paid for destruction of the&#160;species. This is no longer the case and rates have dropped, even in Kodagu in the north of the&#160;species' range,&#160;where (mostly through&#160;shooting with guns)&#160;persecution&#160;is&#160;most intense&#160;(D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014, D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014).","Even despite the recent increase in records and even within well-protected areas,&#160;Nilgiri Marten&#160;sighting rates are startlingly lower than are those of the closely related Yellow-throated Marten <em>Martes&#160;flavigula</em>&#160;(J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014), suggesting that it might naturally occur at low densities.&#160;Nilgiri Marten&#160;was considered rare by Pocock (1941), but during and&#160;since the 1990s it has been seen much more frequently (e.g., 12 sightings in Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve between May 1996 and December 1999; Mudappa 2002). There have been many 21st century&#160;sightings across its range (Krishna and Karnad 2010, Sreehari and Nameer 2013), including many as yet unpublished (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014, D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014, from various first-hand observers).&#160;While sightings in forest areas remain overall&#160;somewhat&#160;rare, local forest-edge communities usually know this distinctive species well and&#160;state that they regularly sight Nilgiri Martens when they raid bee-boxes and when they are treed by domestic dogs.<br/><br/>The population trend is unknown, but given the lack, in recent decades, of strong broad-scale threats such as heavy hunting or habitat loss, it is likely to be relatively stable at present. Hunting was largely an attempt to reduce the loss of bees' boxes (and consequent honey production); a few decades&#160;ago, there were even bounties paid for destruction of the&#160;species, particularly in Kodagu district&#160;(D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014, D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). This is no longer the case and persecution levels may have dropped, as certainly have levels of general recreational hunting. In Kodagu, retaliatory killing remains at a high level across the range,&#160;and&#160;seems unlikely to drop;&#160;some&#160;bee-keepers report a marked decline in Marten sightings in the 20 years to 2014, although it is not clear that this reflects a&#160;significant&#160;decline in population in this part of its range (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Thus,&#160;while it is plausible that the population in Kodagu is still in hunting-led decline, even this is not certain (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014, D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014), and over the rest of the range it is evidently rebuilding its numbers&#160;following the drop in hunting levels. The balance between the two opposing trends&#160;is not clear, but is unlikely to be&#160;strongly downwards, and may even be upwards.",Stable,"Nilgiri Marten is endemic to the Western Ghats of India,&#160;south of 13°N (about Charmad - Kanapadi); 23 localities, most with very recent records, were traced by Sreehari and Nameer (2013).&#160;Most of these localities are in protected areas or reserved forests (see 'Conservation'). In recent times it has&#160;also been photo-documented in tea and other plantation areas adjoining forests, particularly in the Anamalai hills (e.g., Anoop 2013, D. Muddapa pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>It has been recorded across a wide range of elevations from 300 to 2,600 m asl (within 100 m of the&#160;summit of&#160;the highest peak within its&#160;range; Mudappa 1999, Balakrishnan 2005, Krishna and Karnad 2010, D.

The species has been observed to feed mostly on creeping grass in valleys, but to nest in marshy grasslands with slightly taller grasses and sedges, particularly near streams (Vinod 2007)<strong></strong>. In marshy areas, the species nests predominantly in <em>Andropogon polypticus</em> and feeds mainly in <em>Mariscus cyperinus</em><strong> </strong>(Vinod 2007). It is usually found singly or in pairs, even in the non-breeding season. The species breeds from February to June, with a peak in April (Vinod 2007)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is usually two and incubation, exclusively by the female, lasts for 14-15 days. Average territory size has been recorded as 0.15 ha (n = 9; range 0.06-0.25 ha). It feeds on invertebrates, mostly Coleopteran species, and seeds, strongly favouring invertebrates in the breeding season, and switching to a preference for seeds during the non-breeding season. The timing of breeding appears to be associated with higher temperatures and increased invertebrate abundance. It has been recorded consuming the seeds of grasses (<em>Eragrostris nigra</em>, <em>Isachnae kunthiana</em> and <em>Isachaemum ciliare</em>) and a herb (<em>Cyanotis wightii</em>)<strong> </strong>(Vinod 2007). <p></p>","Its grassland habitat is gradually being converted to plantations of tea, eucalyptus and silver wattle <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Acacia dealbata</span>.

New data and information suggest that these subspecies are experiencing significant declines in population size, range size and their habitat over the last decade, and continuing significant declines are expected to occur in future due to intensive human impact. Both of these subspecies are therefore assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2; C1).</p>","<p>The mainland serow is a forest dwelling mammal, and inhabits mountain slopes with rugged steep hills and rocky places from 100 m to 4,000 m (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Paudel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Buzzard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is also recorded in temperate coniferous forests and broadleaved forests in Nepal (Paudel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) and northwest Yunnan, Southwest China (Buzzard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018) and in the dense thickets of Rhododendron and Vaccinium in Vietnam (Abramov&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). It also inhabits lowland montane forests with gentler terrain, including flat areas with shrubs (Li&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The serow occurs also on small offshore islands, such as Cat Ba Island in north Vietnam (Phan <em>et al</em>. 2014) and coastal small islands along the Northern Peninsula in Thailand (S. Lovari pers. comm).<br/><br/>While the mainland serow are sensitive to human disturbance, they seem to tolerate moderately degraded forests and small isolated limestone hills and cliffs in both natural karst scrubland and even disturbed habitats (Lekagul and Mcneely 1988). Studies have found that serow occupancy is positively correlated with distance to roads, distance to villages and distance to trails indicating its preference for areas inaccessible to human encroachment (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The serow prefers closed canopy habitats to open ones, at relatively high altitudes in coniferous and rhododendron forests (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Buzzard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, the species prefers open canopy to closed canopy, in low altitude limestone forests (Phan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>This species normally winters in the forest belt, on flat and hilly slopes, while they move to higher-elevation cliffs and high slopes in the summer season (Wu and Zhang 2004, McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In addition, the separation of habitat selection of this species in winter and summer is based on vegetation type, tree dispersion, slope, elevation, rock dispersion, tree size, slope position, canopy and water sources. However, shelter, and concealment opportunities, as well as distance from water, were not found to be significantly influenced by season (Wu and Zhang 2004).<br/><br/>The species feeds on a wide range of leaves and twigs of at least 33 different plant species in the Cat Ba Island, Vietnam (Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), and 34 plant species in the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal (Giri&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Most of these plant species are shrubs and low growing trees and thus serow is categorised as a typical browser.<br/><br/>The Mainland Serow is active at almost any time, especially at dawn (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b). They shelter under overhanging cliffs and rocks Lovari and Locati 1984). This species may naturally occur at rather low density, compared to other sympatric bovid species such as Goral and Takin (McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is mostly solitary and probably territorial (McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), marking the boundaries of its territory e.g. with dung piles (Lovari and Locati 1994). Several individuals are sometimes seen in the same area, but they feed some distance apart (Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The breeding season occurs on late October and November, and a single kid is born after a seven-month gestation period and will stay with its mother for almost a year (Lekagul and Mcneely 1988).</p>","<p>Currently, the Mainland Serow is facing two main threats, i.e.  over-poaching and habitat loss. Over-poaching, especially using snares  to supply local and regional markets with meat, horns and other body  parts has caused a rapid decline of this species in Southeast Asia  (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Shepherd and Krishnasamy 2014; Leupen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Forest encroachment and clearance in protected and  non-protected areas where this species exists are likely to have had a  significant impact. In addition, most of the plant species consumed by  the serows are medicinal herbs and edible sources for humans and thus  they have been massively exploited by local people (Giri&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011;  Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). These threats may determine a decrease in the  numbers of serows and an increase in the fragmentation of populations,  causing high risks of local extirpations over its range.<br/><br/>In  China, poaching, primarily through snares, is considered the top threat  to wild serow, especially in eastern China where a very dense human  population occurs. Die-offs caused by sarcoptic mange, typically during  late winter to early spring, when the animals are weak, have been widely  reported in western China, which may lead to abrupt decreases or even  elimination of local serow populations (McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In  addition, the meat, fur and other body parts of this species are highly  prized by local people for food and medicinal purposes, and thus the  species faces severe poaching pressure within its Chinese range  (Shackleton, 1997).<br/><br/>Serows are also significantly threatened by  widespread poaching, illegal trade and habitat loss in South-east Asia.  In Cambodia, logging, hunting, habitat loss and vast numbers of  landmines are the main threats to the species. Illegal commercial  hunting, particularly snaring, remains the major threat to the  ground-dwelling mammals in Cardamom Rainforest Landscape and is possibly  impacting populations of most such species in the landscape (Gray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The removal of more than 109,000 snares from the Southern  Cardamom National Park and Tatai Wildlife Sanctuary between 2010 and  2015 was hard evidence of the risks which serows may face (Wildlife  Alliance, unpublished data). In addition, local law enforcement is also  minimal (Gray&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Cambodia has also experienced the most  rapid deforestation rate globally, between 2001 and 2014, and  approximately 1,150 km² of the protected areas in Cardamom Rainforest  Landscape have been lost to Economic Land Concessions for industrial  agriculture (Davis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), thereby reducing the mountainous  habitat for mammals, including the serow in the whole country (Gray&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). In Lao PDR, serow horns, skull bones, leg bones and other  body parts are used for traditional medicine and were recorded in 59  shops, and these items should be derived from a minimum of 150 serows  (Leupen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). There is a cross-border trade in almost all parts  of the serow from Lao PDR to Thailand, Vietnam and China. However, the  effects of this entire disturbance are unknown in Lao PDR (Salter and&#160; Phanthavong, 1997; Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). In Vietnam, the serow is  frequently hunted for bush meat and for commercial purposes. Vietnam is a  significant consumer of wildlife meat, including serow and thus wild  meat is sold in many local markets and serow bones are purchased to make  medicines (Shairp et al., 2016; Nijman and Shepherd, 2017). Over  23,000 snares were discovered and removed by forest rangers in Hue-Quang  Nam Saola Reserve in 2015 (Gray&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The result of this  hunting is a significant decline in the populations of this species in  almost all protected areas in Vietnam (Do Tuoc. pers. comm. 2011). In  Thailand, loss of habitat caused by logging and land clearing for  agriculture, and poaching for meat and medicinal purposes are the major  threats for this species (Lovari, 1997). In addition, poaching for the  trade in trophies (skins and horns), and the collection of non-timber  forest products also negatively impact on the species and damage its  habitat, which has resulted in the species being threatened in almost  all forested areas in Thailand (Lyam&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). Furthermore, the  remaining habitat for wildlife in Thailand is highly fragmented  presently and mostly too small to support viable populations of wildlife  species (Lyam&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In Myanmar, too, the major threats to the  serow include hunting, poaching, habitat degradation, and loss from  deforestation. Wildlife items are widely used in the local pharmacopeia,  and serow items were recorded for sale in 25 medicine shops in Mon  State, south Myanmar (Nijman and Shepherd 2017). Habitat degradation  and deforestation are the main consequences of human activities such  as timber harvesting and agriculture, and fires in the country (Salter  and Shackleton 1997).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, habitat destruction  threatens the long-term survival of the Sumatran serow. The principal  causes of habitat destruction are slash-and-burn agriculture practices  by highlanders and shifting cultivators, as well as the indiscriminate  extraction of timber for export to the West. Serows are caught in snares  as well as shot, for local consumption of the meat, and for use of body  parts in traditional medicines (Holden 2014). Poaching occurs inside  and outside protected areas. Sources living around protected areas in  Sumatra, such as the Gunung Leuser National Park, Aceh, claim that  hunting continues to increase as illegal logging roads have opened up  parts of the park, allowing access to previously inaccessible areas.  Locals claim that populations of serows have been declining. Trade of  body parts, especially the horns, is conducted openly in some places,  such as in the town of Pancur Batu, North Sumatra. Enforcement action  against individuals trading Serow parts does not occur in these  locations.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, the Sumatran Serow faces several  primary threats from habitat destruction caused by limestone quarrying  and poaching for illegal commercial trade (Shepherd and Krishnasamy 2014). Serows also suffer from substantial poaching for its meat and  body parts that are used for medicinal and purportedly magical purposes  (Rahman 1997). The species is threatened by the widespread setting of  snares and it is targeted species whenever poachers have access to its  rugged habitats (Krishnasamy and Or 2014). Over the past two years,  enforcement authorities have taken action against individuals involved  in illegal hunting of this species, and as a result, trade of this  species is not carried out openly, as it is in other areas of  its-Southeast Asian range. Very little information on current population  sizes of this species exists. Local people living near serow habitat  state that populations seem to be declining, due to hunting and to mining  activities (limestone and quartz). Eighteen out of 165 restaurants, that  served bushmeat in Peninsular Malaysia, offered the meat of this  species (Shepherd and Krishnasamy 2014).<br/><br/>In the Himalayan  range, habitat destruction and resource competition with livestock are  key-threats to the Mainland serow throughout its range, even in  protected areas. Disease transmission (sarcoptic mange and goat pox)  seems to be a rising concern wherever serow overlap with domestic  livestock, particularly sheep. Herders have reported finding dead serow  with symptoms such as extremely dry skin, with rupturing and bleeding  across the body, hair loss and foaming in the mouth in Jammu and  Kashmir, Himachal, Uttarakhand (Khanyari <em>et al</em>. 2019). In  Arunachal’s Tawang district, a recent outbreak of goat pox has severely  impacted serows. According to local people, goat pox emerges every few  years in the region when serow and goral populations reach high  densities (Janaki Mohan pers. comm. 2020), although the other way round  looks rather more likely.<br/><br/>Poaching remains a serious threat to  serow in most parts of Himalayan range. Most hunting in Himachal is  subsistence only and is done particularly in winter months when the  animals are seen more easily. In Arunachal, the serow is widely hunted  both for subsistence and for sale. In Upper Siang district, gun hunting  is rare and local hunters lay snare traps near salt licks. Datta-Roy  (2019) noted that hunting in these community forests is strictly  controlled by village institutions.<br/><br/>Infrastructure development,  including dams and highways in Sikkim and Arunachal, which may be the  species strongholds, are a rising cause of large-scale habitat  destruction.<br/><br/>Habitat disturbance and poaching are the greatest  threats to its survival also in Bangladesh, both related to slash and  burn cultivations (Khan 1985). Over-hunting, habitat destruction by  human and livestock, and habitat fragmentation are main threats to the  serow population decline in Nepal (Aryal 2009, Giri&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). In  Bhutan, the species is rarely hunted and populations appear to be  stable.</p>","<p>There are no estimates of the total population size and trend of the Mainland serow throughout its range. It is believed that populations have been fragmented and significantly declined through time, and its distribution range has been gradually reduced due to the loss of habitat and intervening forest clearance, with excessive poaching in many areas.<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>Capricornis sumatraensis sumatraensis: </em>No population estimates have been made on the Sumatran Serow. In Indonesia, this sub-species was recorded by camera traps in some national parks, such as Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Salatan, however, the status of this species is already very rare in these national parks because of deforestation and illegal poaching (Pakpahan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Dwiyahreni Asri pers. comm. 2020). For example, the serow was considered 'rare' in Kerinci Seblat National Park, based on camera-trap surveys in 2005 and 2006 (Leader-Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006) and hundreds of thousands of hour camera-trap surveys in Sumatra in six years, only one photo-trapped at 2,700 m on a volcanic peak (Holden 2014). Also, in Malaysia information on the status of serow is not available, but it is considered threatened and significantly declined in Peninsular Malaysia (Shepherd and Krishnasamy 2014). A total of 30 artificial salt licks were developed in 10 protected areas in Malaysia, and they were monitored in 2011 and 2013 but this sub-species rarely visited these artificial salt licks (Magintan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Subspecies<em> C. s. mildneedwardsii: </em>Populations of this sub-species in southeast China (south of the Yangtze river) are small and isolated, and this subspecies’ general distribution range falls within regions with relatively dense human populations which are well-exploited economic areas (Sung&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). Camera-trapping surveys conducted in numerous reserves across this region indicated that serow is the least detected ungulate species and its abundance is extremely low (Chen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a). Although no population estimates have been made in this area, numbers are believed to be decreasing and its distribution range has gradually been reduced. In southwest China, serow populations are generally considered stable in most well-managed nature reserves, whereas there are cases of a decrease observed in some reserves following the rapid increase of free-ranging livestock over the last few decades (Li., unpublished data). While co-existing with other meso-large bovid species, such as Takin and Goral, in forest ecosystems, serows have the lowest detection and relative abundance according to camera-trapping surveys (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>In Cambodia the population status of this sub-species is unknown and serows are probably naturally restricted to the hilly and mountainous terrain that surround the Mekong and Tonle Sap central plains. An intensive camera-trap survey was conducted within Phom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary in eastern Cambodia in 2008 and 2009, and 23 species were recorded, including four large ungulate species but serow was not recorded (Gray and Phan 2011). In addition, camera-trap detection levels of this sub-species were low and restricted to the Cardamoms, south-west Cambodia and Virachey National Park, north-eastern Cambodia (Gray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In Lao PDR, data on population size and trend of this sub-species are unavailable. However, the sub-species showed a low detection rate in camera-trap surveys in Xe Sap National Protected Area, in southern Lao PDR (Tilker 2014) and has a density of 0.22 individual/km² in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area in northern Lao PDR (Vongkhamheng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). In addition, this sub-species is potentially considered at risk in Lao PDR (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999). In Thailand, the population and status of this sub-species is unknown and showed a low detection rate in camera-trap surveys, in Dong Phayayen - Khao Yai Forest Complex, in southern Thailand (Lyam&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Serows had a very low detection rate in Kuiburi National Park, in south-western Thailand (Steinmetz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) and in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, in western Thailand (Steinmetz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In Vietnam, population numbers are unknown, an exception being about 26 individuals left in the Cat Ba Island, in north Vietnam (Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). This sub-species was recorded in almost all protected areas from northern to southern central areas of Vietnam, but populations are small and scattered, and numbers are probably low (Nguyen Xuan Dang and Le Xuan Canh, 2009; Dang Ngoc Can&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). It is believed that populations in the northern highlands are heavily depleted in number and the populations are highly fragmented. However, they are likely to be more present in most protected areas along the Annamite mountains of central Vietnam. For example, five monitoring programs used 591camera traps in Pu Mat National Park in central Vietnam and recorded 94 photos of serows from 2016 to 2018 (Tran Xuan Cuong pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>C. s. thar:&#160;</em> No counts have been made in Bangladesh, but numbers are believed to be  very low. In addition, serows have not been detected by camera-trap  surveys from 2011 to 2015 in the Sangu Reserve Forest in the  southeastern, Bangladesh (CCA 2016). In Bhutan’s Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Wang (2010) used distance sampling to estimate serow density of 0.36 individuals/km². In India, the population size of this sub-species is not available, but  its density seems to be fair in good habitat: within Kedarnath Wildlife  Sanctuary (Uttaranchal) it has been estimated at 1.6 serow/km² within suitable habitat (Green 1987). This sub-species was frequently detected using camera traps from 2008 to  2010 in Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, Sikkim (Bhattacharya&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2012).  In Arunachal’s Dibang Valley, Nijhawan (2018) estimated serow densities from camera trapped data using at 0.62 (0.26-1.46) and 0.25 (0.10-0.59) individuals/km2 in two separate community forests and 0.19 (0.08-0.49) individuals/km2 in Dibang WLS.

In Himachal, populations are reportedly declining in most areas though local herders report easy detections during winter months (November-February). In Nepal, no estimates of population size are available, but density within the Annapurna Conservation Area has been estimated at 1.17 individual/km², significantly declined over the last few decades (Aryal 2009).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Mainland Serow occurs across eleven countries, including China, Southeast Asia and Himalayan range. <br/><br/>Subspecies <em>Capricornis sumatraensis sumatraensis </em>is found in Indonesia (Sumatra), Malaysia (Peninsular Malaya), Thailand (south of about 9°S latitude) (Grubb, 2005). In Indonesia, this sub-species is restricted entirely to the volcanic mountain chain of the Bukit Barisan mountains in Sumatra, especially in the Aceh highlands in the north, the Kerinci highlands in the centre and the Barisan Seletan highlands in the south (Dwiyahreni Asri pers. comm. 2020). It is also found scattered through Peninsular (West) Malaysia, but concentrated in the northern states, especially Kelantan, Perlis and Perak. The species has been recorded in 50 areas in Peninsular Malaysia (Rahman 1997), but the species has significantly decreased in these areas (Shepherd and&#160;Krishnasamy 2014).<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>C. s. mildneedwardsii </em>occurs in much of Myanmar, Cambodia, south and central China (extends to eastern Himalayas and Indo-Burma), Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam (Grubb 2005). The sub-species is widely distributed through much of central and south-eastern China, including southern Shaanixi, southern Gansu, southeastern Qinghai, western Sichuan, eastern Tibet, Yunnan, Guangzi, Guizhou, Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubai, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian provinces. However, this sub-species is replaced in parts of northern Myanmar by <em>Capricornis rubidus</em> (Smith and&#160;Xie 2008).<br/><br/>Records show a more or less continuous distribution along the ranges of the Hungduan mountain system. East of this region, populations occur in adjacent mountain areas of Qinling (Southern Slope), Shaanxi and Guizhou (Zhen 1982). A few populations exist in the north-western Hengduan Mountains of Yushu and Nangqqian (Qinghai) (Li <em>et al</em>. 1989). This subspecies has a comparatively widespread distribution from eastern to southern China, through western and southern Zhejiang, northern Fujian, most of Jiangxi, eastern Guizhou (Luo <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;1985), northern Guangdong, eastern and south-western Guangxi, eastern and southern Yunnan, where it inhabits low mountains and foothills. It may also occur in south-western Sichuan, as indicated by specimens from the adjacent mountains of Jijiang.<br/><br/>Two subspecies (<em>C. s. sumatraensis </em>and <em>C. s. milneedwardsii</em>)<em> </em>originally were widely distributed throughout Thailand, but they are now restricted to steep, forested limestone hills and cliffs, in areas relatively inaccessible to human encroachment (Lovari, 1997). Therefore, their populations are highly fragmented, with a low density (Lovari 1997, Lyam&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Steinmetz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). The dividing line between the ranges of <em>C. s. milneedwardsii</em> and <em>C.s. sumatraensis</em> is unclear, but it is suspected to fall somewhere in the Chooporn or Suratchathani Provinces (Grubb 2005).<br/><br/>The historic distribution of <em>C. s. milneedwarsii </em>in Lao PDR almost certainly included the vast majority of the countries, the majority of which is hilly to mountainous (Lekagul and McNeely1988). Currently in Lao PDR the sub-species is restricted to rugged terrain areas, especially along the Annamite mountain range of eastern central and southern Lao PDR (Vongkhamheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Tilker 2014). In Cambodia the species is probably naturally restricted to the hill and mountainous terrain that surround the Mekong and Tonle Sap (lake) central plains (Gray and Phan 2011, Gray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In Viet Nam the serows were recorded in almost all protected areas from northern to the south-central areas of the country, especially where forested limestone mountains and cliffs occured (Nguyen Xuan Dang and Le Xuan Canh 2009). During mammal surveys from 1999 to 2008, serows were found in the northern Vietnam, including Ha Giang, Cao Bang, Lai Chau, Tuyen Quang, Bac Kan, Phu Tho, Thai Nguyen, Vinh Phuc, Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Hoa Binh and Ninh Binh provinces; in the northern central areas of Vietnam, such as Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue; in the central areas of Viet Nam, including &#160;Quang Nam, Kon Tum, Gia Lai, Dak Lac, Dak Nong and Lam Dong provinces, and in the southern central areas of Vietnam, including in Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan and Ninh Thuan provinces (Dang Ngoc Can&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). The species has also been recorded from offshore islands in the north, e.g. Cat Ba (Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). However, there is no further information available on its distribution status and it is believed that this sub-species has significantly declined due to poaching in Viet Nam.<br/><br/>The general distribution in Myanmar appears to follow the forested mountain ranges surrounding the central plains. Its distribution in the northwest is believed to stretch through the Chin Hills from the border with India, probably as far south as 20ºN in the Arakan Yoma range. A larger distribution area occurs in the mountains in the north (Kachin state) and in the mountains east of about 96ºW, to Myanmar’s borders with China, Lao PDR and Thailand (Grubb 2005).<br/><br/>Subspecies: <em>C. s.thar </em>is known to occur in east and southeast Bangladesh, Himalayas (Bhutan, northern India including Sikkim and Nepal), China (Tibet only), northeast India (provinces east of Bangladesh), and probably into western Myanmar (Grubb 2005). This sub-species is widespread though sparsely distributed throughout the Himalayas from Jammu and Kashmir through Nepal and Bhutan till the eastern side of Arunachal Pradesh. Its distribution is generally fragmented and throughout the majority of its range in India, it naturally occurs in low density. In the state of Jammu and Kashmir, its presence has been confirmed through camera traps and direct sightings from the districts of Srinagar (Dachigam National Park, Brien-Nishta Wildlife Conservation Reserve), Kishtwar (Kishtwar National Park), Ganderbal/Anantnag (Overu-Aru Wildlife Sanctuary), and Baramulla (Tangmarg-Gulmarg valleys) (Sathyakumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Tawqir Bhat pers. comm. 2019, Munib Khanyari pers. comm. 2019). In Himachal Pradesh, Pandey (2002) reported that the species is found extensively in the Sutlej and Beas River catchments in the state. More recently it has been confirmed from the districts of Shimla (Rupi Valley, Narkanda Valley, Dodra-Kwar region), Lower Kinnaur (Bhaba valley), Kullu (Great Himalayan National Park including Thirthan, Sainj, Parvati and Jeeva Nala), Kangra (Barabangal region), Chamba (Lower Bharmour and Upper Dalhousie region though believed to be nearly extinct in this area) (Munib Khanyari pers. comm. 2019). They are occasionally sighted in abandoned farmland in these areas. In Uttarakhand, serow presence has been confirmed via camera-trap surveys from Rudraprayag (Kedarnath Forest Division, Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary) (GTF&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019) and Pauri Garhwal (Lansdowne Forest Division) (Pawar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), distribution in the rest of the state remains uncertain, but the species is likely be present in forest patches from 500 to 3,500 m in elevation. The serow is widely distributed across Sikkim where camera-trap surveys have confirmed populations in East Sikkim Wildlife and Forest Division (Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary, Kyongnosla WLS), North Sikkim Forest Division and Khangchendzonga NP (Sathyakumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Bhattacharya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012; Srivastava and Kumar 2018). In West Bengal, it is extant in Darjeeling Wildlife Division (Singalila National Park) and Gorumara Wildlife Division (Neora Valley National Park) (GTF&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Assam, the species occurs in hilly tracts on the north bank of Bramhaputra river and has been reported from the districts of Kokrajhar (Ripu and Chirang Reserve Forests), Sonitpur (Nameri National Park), rare but seen in winter in Lakhimpur (Ranga, Kakoi and Dulung Reserve Forests), and Dhemaji (Subansiri Reserve Forest) (Choudhury 2003).<br/><br/>In Arunachal Pradesh, the sub-species is widely distributed across protected areas and community owned forests from lowland forests up to 3,500 m. Camera-trap surveys, where it is often captured, and hunter interviews have confirmed populations in the districts of Lower Subansiri (Hapoli Forest Division, Talle Valley WLS), Upper Siang (Yingkiong Forest Division), West Kameng (Eaglenest WLS), Tawang and West Siang (Yorde Rabe Subse WLS), Lower Dibang Valley, Dibang Valley (where it is frequently recorded in very steep terrain), Lohit, Anjaw and Changlang districts. In Namdapha Tiger Reserve, the species overlaps with <em>C. rubidus. </em>No records of <em>C. s. thar </em>have emerged south of Tirap and Longding districts in Arunachal. <em>C. rubidus</em> is found in the hill tracts south of Brahmaputra and appears to be the only serow species from southwards from Nagaland into Bangladesh.<br/><br/>Serow appears to be widely distributed in Nepal across its community forests and protected areas and has been reported form Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), Sagarmatha National Park (NP), Makalu Barun NP and CA, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Langtang NP, Khaptad NP, Rara NP and perhaps in Shey-Phoksundo NP and Chitwan NP. They have also been reported from Kanchanpur, Taplejung, Ramechhap and Illam districts. The only serow-focused research conducted in the country by Aryal (2008) in Annapurna Conservation Area found that the species prefers altitudes between 2,500 and 3,500 m and slopes between 20-40 degrees. The species also appears to be widely distributed in Bhutan up to an altitude of 3,500 m. It is regularly camera trapped in subtropical and temperate zones of Royal Manas, Black Mountain and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park.<br/><br/>In China, this sub-species occurs in the forest belt between 2,000 and 3,000 m only in the narrow area on south slope of Qomolangma on the border with Nepal. Observations of serow running across highways are not infrequent. A population is found in the Yaluzangbu Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve, where it inhabits sub-alpine forests and has been recorded in camera-trap surveys and by wildlife photographers (Wen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Wu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Mcshea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In Medog county, southeast Tibet, China, the Himalayan Serow is the most detected bovid species by camera-trap surveys (Wen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Wu <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p>The Mainland serow is listed in Appendix I of the CITES (The Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), which prohibits international commercial trade of the species, its body parts and derivatives. <br/><br/>In Indonesia, the species has been protected by law since 1932. A total of 3,083,308 ha of serow habitat are under some form of protection in a system of protected areas that includes three national parks, three game reserves, three nature reserves and two protected forests. The species is afforded fully legal protection in Peninsular Malaysia under Wildlife Conservation Act, 2010, which means that hunting this species is prohibited. The serow is classified as Category II on the State Key Protected Animal List, under the Wildlife Protection Law of China (Smith and Xie 2008), and Potentially at Risk in Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). However, it seems that there is no actual legislation aimed at conserving the serow in Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand. In Vietnam, the animal is listed as IB (hunting prohibited) in the Endangered and Rare Species List in Degree 32, in 2006, and Endangered (E) in the Vietnamese Red Book, in 2008. The serow is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of India and Forest and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan which bans all hunting. In Nepal its hunting is banned by law (Wegge and Oli 1997). The serow is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of India (WLPA, 1972) and Forest and Nature conservation act of Bhutan which bans all hunting. In Nepal too, it’s hunting is completely banned by law (Wegge and Oli 1997).<br/><br/>So far, there have been just a few research projects focused on the distribution and status of serows throughout its range, except several studies, e.g. in Cat Ba Island, Vietnam (Phan <em>et al</em>. 2014) and in Annapurna Conservation Area, (Aryal, 2008). Camera-trap surveys were conducted by conservation organisations (e.g. WWF, FFI and WCS) in protected areas throughout Southeast Asia to monitor and assess the distribution status of wildlife animals, including serows. For example, in Vietnam, WWF cooperated with Song Thanh Nature Reserve and Bac Hai Van Nature Reserve to monitor wildlife animals through establishing camera-traps, and recorded the presence of serows in these reserves (Mai Sy Luan pers.comm. 2020). Similarly, FFI and SVW conducted a camera-trap survey in Pu Mat National Park to monitor wildlife and recorded the evidence of serows (Tran Xuan Cuong, pers.comm. 2020). WWF-India, Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Nijhawan (2018) and by the Nature Conservation Division of The Department of Forest and Park Service of Bhutan have conducted widespread camera trapping surveys in India and Bhutanese Himalayas. However, these data have not been made available for focused research on this species.<br/><br/>More research on distribution and status as well as the impact of hunting and trading of Mainland Serows throughout its range is urgently needed. In addition, relevant information on the ecology and behaviour of this species should be published and brought to the attention of relevant enforcement agencies, conservation organisations and the public, to advertise the threats that this species is facing, and increase the efforts to save it from further local extinctions.</p>",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

It breeds by direct development, and parental care is described in Seshadri <em>et al</em>. (2015).","This species is reliant on holes made by the&#160;Nilgiri palm squirrel (<em>Funambulus sublineatus</em>), which is Vulnerable and declining, to inhabit the bamboo, and any declines in the the squirrel population will be detrimental to this species (Seshadri K.S. pers. comm. October 2020).&#160;In Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, some habitat loss due to bamboo harvesting is considered to be a minor threat, although it is a more serious threat outside of protected areas where the species has not been recently observed (Seshadri K.S.&#160;pers. comm. October 2020). It is also inadvertently collected via local subsistence bamboo harvesting (India Red List Assessment Workshop October 2020). In Kerala, Athirumala in Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve an annual pilgrimage takes place, involving hundreds of people per day during the duration of a month (January-March), which results in littering and firewood collection, and potential disturbance to the species' breeding activity (India Red List Assessment Workshop October 2020). However, as this is not a ground dwelling species, this is probably not a major threat to it (S.D. Biju pers. comm. June 2021). Climate change is a likely future threat which may result in the drying of habitat caused by warmer temperatures and changes in rainfall, as well as the shifting of habitat with subpopulations that already exist in higher elevations possibly being lost as they have no habitat to migrate to (Seshadri K.S.&#160;pers. comm.

Since the total occupied area in India has been variously estimated at between 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chauhan 2006) and 400,000 km² (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), or even more (Puri <em>et al</em>. 2015), it is impossible to gauge population trend from changes in occupied area. However, there is, throughout most of the range, a clear trend in deterioration of habitat, which has caused Sloth Bear populations to decline (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008). This deterioration in habitat is expected to accelerate in the future.<br/> <br/> Habitat outside of protected areas is under severe and growing pressure due to demands for natural resources and the ever increasing populations of both humans and livestock in the region (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006a). This problem is compounded by many factors including that in India, where the vast majority of Sloth Bear habitat is located: 1) the per capita forest area is only one-tenth of the world’s average; 2) there is a demand–supply gap for construction timber leading to over-harvesting and degradation of natural ecosystems; 3) an estimated 78% of forests are subjected to heavy grazing causing degradation of forest habitat; and 4) vast stretches of forest are still diverted for a variety of developmental and infrastructural projects (Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India 2009). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2015) reported that India had a 0.3% rate increase of forest area during 2010-2015, due to afforestation. However, the type and location of all the forest planted is unspecified. Much of this afforestation effort is occurring in more urban areas and it is not known how much is accessible to Sloth Bears.<br/> <br/> The human population growth in India is presently the greatest threat to Sloth Bears. It drives the loss and degradation of habitat and is likely the cause for growing human-bear conflicts in the country. The population of India is expected to increase by 366,000,000 people (roughly 30%) over the next 30 years&#160; (US Census bureau, International database <a href=""http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php"">http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php</a>). This extraordinary population growth is likely to have major direct and indirect impacts on Sloth Bear populations, especially those existing outside protected areas. The human population growth of India is particularly alarming because 90-95%of the range of Sloth Bears is in India. Likewise, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> (2007) predicted a future decline in Sloth Bear numbers in Sri Lanka due to burgeoning human densities and commensurate habitat deterioration and increasing conflicts.<br/> <br/> The recent extirpation of Sloth Bears in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013) highlights serious concerns over persistence of small, isolated Sloth Bear populations, especially outside of protected areas, where half or more of the populations exist. Sloth Bears are particularly vulnerable to loss of habitat because of their reliance on lowland areas, which tend to be the places most readily used and developed by people. Moreover, the aggressiveness of this species makes them incompatible with high human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Given the lack of effective measures to control the rate of habitat loss and exploitation, Sloth Bear populations are expected to continue declining, at an increasing rate, resulting in a &gt;30% loss over the next 30 years (three generations).</p>","<p>Sloth Bears subsist primarily on termites, ants, and fruits. Sloth Bears are the only species of bear adapted specifically for myrmecophagy (ant and termite-eating; Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). Like other myrmecphagous mammals, they have especially small home ranges compared to other ursids (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006b). The ratio of insects to fruits in the diet varies with the seasonal and geographical availability of each food (Baskaran <em>et al.</em> 1997, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1997, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Mewada and Dharaiya 2010, Sukhadiya <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fruits may comprise 70‒90% of the diet during the fruiting season, whereas termites and other insects may comprise &gt;80% of the diet the rest of the year (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears occupy a wide range of habitats on the Indian mainland including wet and dry tropical forests, savannahs, scrublands, and grasslands (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ramesh <em>et al.</em> 2012). They are primarily a lowland species. Most Sloth Bear range in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is limited to habitats below 1500 m, although the species may occur as high as 2,000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats (Johnsingh 2003, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Sri Lanka, Sloth Bears are confined to the remaining dry forests in the north and eastern parts of the island, mostly below 300 m (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006). In areas where forest cover is sparse but daytime temperatures are high (a large part of the range), the bear is principally nocturnal or crepuscular and shelters in rock outcrops, thickets, and tree cavities during the heat of the day. Although some Sloth Bears may be active during the day in protected areas (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999), they tend to be almost exclusively nocturnal in disturbed and fragmented forests interspersed with human habitations (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004; Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2012).<br/> <br/> Studies in Nepal and Sri Lanka suggest that Sloth Bears avoid areas where human disturbance is high, so crop depredation by Sloth Bears is uncommon (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). However, in some parts of India, Sloth Bears routinely raid peanut, maize, and fruit crops (Chhangani 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160; In some of these areas the habitats are severely degraded and affected by human exploitation, including the extraction of several food sources of the Sloth Bear.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears typically breed May through July, and females give birth, usually to one or two cubs, from November to January (Laurie and Seidensticker 1977, Iswariah 1984, Gopal 1991, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999, Chauhan <em>et al.</em> 2003, Spady <em>et al.</em> 2007). Cubs often ride on the mother's back during their first nine months, presumably to reduce the risk of predation. Cubs remain with their mothers for 1.5-2.5 years resulting in a 2 or 3 year interbirth interval (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999).</p>","<p>Major threats to this species are habitat loss or degradation (often related to human population growth), retaliation from human‒bear conflicts, and (to a lesser degree) poaching (Johnsingh 2003, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bargali <em>et al. </em>2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (e.g. teak, eucalyptus), over-grazing, extraction of minerals, quarrying, settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990).<br/> <br/> In some parts of the range, encounters between people and Sloth Bears have led to numerous serious human injuries and many deaths (Rajpurohit and Krausman 2000, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Such incidents occur where people frequently use bear habitat, and where the habitat has become severely degraded, prompting bears to seek food and water in closer proximity to humans. Most attacks occur when people and bears surprised each other in thickets or around rock outcrops, where visibility is obstructed: the bear(s)—sometimes multiple adult bears are involved—rush at, pursue, and knock down the person, and often attack the face. Bears that attack or threaten to attack people may ultimately be killed. Sloth Bear attacks outside protected areas are increasing, and hostility of local people towards bears has made bear conservation more difficult (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Mardaraj 2014). Increasing numbers of Sloth Bear attacks appear to be related to rising human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> The only natural (non-human) threats to Sloth Bears are Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and possibly Leopards (<em>P. pardus</em>). The threat of Tiger predation may account for the aggressive nature of Sloth Bears (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999). Sloth Bears have been observed fending off Tigers, but they are also occasionally killed by Tigers (Gopal 1991).</p>","<p>Information is available on the area of potentially occupied range in India (Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar<em> et al. </em>2012), Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a), and Sri Lanka (Ratnayeke <em>et al</em>. 2007a,b). The potential Sloth Bear distribution in India was estimated to be <em>ca.</em> 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al. </em>2004, Chauhan 2006) but the more recent National Bear Conservation and Welfare Action Plan 2012 (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the occupied range is twice that large (400,000 km²). An even more recent survey suggested that Sloth Bears may occupy 52% of the land area of India (Puri <em>et al.</em> 2015). Notably, though, the latter study was based on very large sampling cells (2,800 km² across a sampling region of nearly 3 million km²), and any cell estimated to be occupied would have been considered as fully occupied; this would inflate the range area considerably. In short, the results of this study do not appear to reflect the reality of Sloth Bear distribution in India as they clearly do not occur in &gt;50% of the land area. Additionally, the model predicts Sloth Bear occurrence in specific places where they are known to be absent, such as Gir Forest. However, the study does demonstrate that Sloth Bears can live in relatively small degraded areas.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears can occur at high densities. However, there are few reliable Sloth Bear density estimates: most estimates have been based on opinions gleaned from interviews and questionnaires (e.g., Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006). The one robust density estimate for this species, which was based on mark–resight of radio-collared bears, yielded an estimate of 27 bears/100 km² for Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and as high as 72 bears/100 km² in a core area of the park (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). Gopalaswamy (2006) attempted a rigorous estimate based on presence-absence records at camera traps (as per Royle and Nichols 2003), but detection rates were too low to produce a useful estimate.<br/> <br/> Attempts have been made to apply estimated densities in various protected areas to all occupied areas to obtain a range-wide population estimate. Depending on methods and data employed in this process, range-wide estimates have varied from &lt;10,000 to &gt;20,000 bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). None of these estimates are considered reliable enough to track changes in population size, especially since the total range area is not well defined. Estimates for individual Indian states are also not reliable enough to track population trends (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The population of Sloth Bears on the island of Sri Lanka is equally not well understood. Santiapillai and Santiapillai (1990) tentatively reported a population of 300–600 bears for the island. Ratneyeke <em>et al.</em> (2007a) estimated, based on home ranges of radio-collared bears that Wasgomuwa National Park alone may support more than 100-150 sloth bears. This national park only makes up roughly 5% of the known Sloth Bear range in Sri Lanka and therefore the population likely well exceeds the previous estimate.<br/> <br/> Increased habitat fragmentation and a decrease of occupied habitat have been observed in many parts of the Sloth Bear range (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008, Bargali 2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). However, rigorous assessments of population change are rare. Jhala <em>et al.</em> (2011) compared occupancy of Sloth Bears in select areas from 2006 to 2010, during a comprehensive Tiger survey across India, and reported five decreasing, four increasing, and three stable bear populations; although the methods and short time span between surveys probably precluded a reliable indication of population trend.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sloth Bear’s historical distribution includes a large portion of India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, as well as the southern lowlands of Nepal and presumably Bhutan. Some unverified reports suggested that they once occurred in the western-most corner of present day Myanmar (Erdbrink 1953), but this was never confirmed and seems unlikely based on the mountainous habitat. Historically this species overlapped the distributions of Asiatic Black Bears (<span class=""sciname""><em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) in northern India (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2012), and with both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears (<em>Helarctos malayanus</em>) in northeastern India (Choudhury 2011).&#160;Historical records are confusing, though, because Sloth Bears and Asiatic Black Bears look alike and were often not reliably distinguished.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>India</u></strong><br/> At least 90% of the present Sloth Bear range occurs in India. Within India their distribution is constrained to the south by the ocean, to the northwest by deserts, and to the north and east by mountains. Although Sloth Bears were once common and even abundant throughout the Indian Peninsula (McTaggart Cowan 1972, Krishnan 1972, Brander 1982), their range has shrunk and densities reduced due to continuous habitat loss and human-caused mortalities. Although still found scattered across much of its former range, their actual distribution is now highly fragmented and confined mainly to five distinct regions, namely northern, northeastern, central, southeastern, and southwestern (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a, Johnsingh 2003, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The northern distribution region occurs largely within the state of Uttarakhand (Bargali 2012), but also includes the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and the northwestern tip of Bihar. This northern region borders the southern and western areas of Nepal and includes trans-border populations. However, the northern region remains completely isolated from the other population regions in India due to large scale forest removal and agriculture and human settlements.<br/> <br/> The northeastern region is the farthest east that this species occurs and is perhaps the least understood region in terms of Sloth Bear distribution. The bulk of the distribution appears to occur in the state of Assam (Choudhury 2011, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), though Sloth Bears are also known from Manipur, Megalaya and Arunachal Pradesh (where it is very rare). The fact that the distribution of Sloth Bears in this region overlaps with that of both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears has made reports of Sloth Bear occurrence less reliable.<br/> <br/> The central region is the largest region. The bulk of the distribution occurs in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, but includes the states of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Just south of this region, in the southern half of Andhra Pradesh, is the southeastern region, which occurs along the Eastern Ghats. It is not known whether bears move between the central and southeastern regions.<br/> <br/> The southwestern area follows the Western Ghats and principally falls within the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where there may be a connection to the southeastern region. They have been observed up to 2,000 m elevation in the Western Ghats (A.J.T. Johnsingh, personal communication, in Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a). They also stretch northwestward into Gujarat and Rajasthan.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Nepal</u></strong><br/> In Nepal, Sloth Bears are most common within the narrow strip of lowland grassland–forest mosaic called the Terai. They also range into the lower Siwaliks (maximum elevation is unknown). The bears are mainly in protected areas in the central and western portions of the Terai. Since the mid-1980s, they were thought to have been extirpated from the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve in western Nepal, an area containing the largest patch of continuous grassland in Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). However, during a 2013 Tiger camera trap study in the reserve a photo of a Sloth Bear was captured. Then in 2014 Sloth Bear tracks and scat were recorded in the reserve as well (Babu Ram Lamichane, National Trust for Nature Conservation—Suklaphanta Conservation Program, pers. comm., 2015). Therefore, it appears that Sloth Bears have recolonized Sulka Phanta Wildlife Reserve, likely from adjacent Piliphit Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh, India, which is known to have Sloth Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012); alternately, Sloth Bears persisted in such small numbers that they went undetected for several years (Johnsingh 2003). Some of the Sloth Bear populations in Nepal remain connected with the Indian northern region (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bangladesh</u><br/> </strong>Sloth Bears have been extirpated from Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013). The last documented records are from the mid-1990s (NCSIP-1 2001, Sarker 2006). Although they had been present in the southeastern, eastern and northeastern parts of the country, the forest patches in which they persisted have been largely removed (Sarker 2006).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bhutan</u></strong><br/> Recent investigations suggest that if Sloth Bears occupy Bhutan, they are very rare. Garshelis <em>et al.</em> (1999a) mapped two populations of Sloth Bears in Bhutan, including Royal Manas National Park (RMNP) and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Their range map was based on habitat-elevation information and purported documentation of presence.&#160; However, due to frequent confusion in distinguishing Sloth Bears from Asiatic Black Bears, it is now apparent that this range map was wrong. Sloth Bears appear to have a much narrower range in Bhutan, if at all. One camera trap photo in RMNP, taken in 2009, 2 km from the Indian border, is the only current verified record of presence (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Grasslands, which are preferred habitat for Sloth Bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999 a,b; Choudhury 2011) are present in both RMNP and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and both of these protected areas are connected to protected areas in India, known to contain sloth bears. However, it is not known whether a true trans-boundary population exists anywhere along this border, or if just a few vagrant bears occasionally come across to the Bhutan side (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Sri Lanka</u></strong><br/> The Sri Lankan Sloth Bear subspecies is distributed in the north and east sides of the island and is closely tied with forest cover (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). Sloth Bears occupy roughly 17% of the island and there is still a high connectivity between occupied areas. However, recent civil war activities largely occurred in the northern and eastern sides of the island, which are home to the largest contiguous forest patches and which historically supported healthy Sloth Bear populations. These areas have gone largely unprotected and it is still unknown how sloth bear distribution may have been affected (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007a).</p>","<p>Poaching of Sloth Bears for trade in parts has been reported (Servheen 1990, Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), but its current extent and impact on bear populations is uncertain. Compared to other Asian bear species, commercial trade in Sloth Bear parts appears to be relatively low (Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014). Poaching also occurs for local use: male reproductive organs used as aphrodisiac; bones, teeth and claws used to ward off evil spirits; bear fat used for native medicine and hair regeneration (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997, Chauhan 2006). Occasional rashes of poaching incidents have been reported. For example, in Madhya Pradesh in 2014, at least eight male bears were found professionally poached, as indicated by the skilful removal of their reproductive organs, gall bladders and claws (Basu 2014, Naveen 2014). Two of the dead bears were found near the buffer area of Khana Tiger Reserve, while the others were found in less protected forests in the state. The manner in which the bear parts were removed led many to speculate that that the poaching may be taking place on a larger scale and that the parts may have been removed for illegal international trade.<br/> <br/> The capture of cubs, which often includes the killing of the mother bear, for use as street-show ""dancing bears"" (Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997) used to be a threat in some parts of India, but has been controlled to a significant level (D’Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2011). This practice has been illegal in India since 1972, though it continued in earnest until 2009. However it persists to a small degree in southern Nepal. It is unclear if the practitioners were always in Nepal or if they crossed the border to Nepal from India due to the political pressure to end the practice in India. Several dancing bears have been confiscated at the Nepal-India border while they were being brought into India (K. Satyanarayan, Wildlife SOS, personal communication, 2015). Additionally, a cub was rescued that was being smuggled into Nepal with clear signs that it was to be sold for use as a dancing bear (Wildlife SOS 2015).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Sloth Bears are listed in Appendix I of CITES and are completely protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. They are also protected to varying degrees by national laws in the other range countries. However, they can be killed to protect life or property.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears are reported to exist in 174 Protected Areas (PAs) in India, which include 46 National Parks and 128 Wildlife Sanctuaries (Chauhan 2006). Populations appear to be reasonably well protected when inside these PAs, but face deteriorating habitat conditions outside (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dharaiya, 2009). Reduced cover and food resources outside PAs (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004) have led to increased human–bear conflicts, including frequent maulings (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is estimated that half to two-thirds of the Sloth Bears in India live outside PAs. Roughly half the occupied range in Sri Lanka occurs outside PAs (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b).<br/> <br/> Human-bear conflicts, both crop raiding and bear attacks, are a growing concern for this species. Given the aggressive nature of this animal, and the increasing number of encounters between bears and people, these bears are widely feared. Although education may help reduce human-bear conflicts and enhance a conservation ethic among locals, the root of the problem is largely related to the expansion of human settlement and deteriorating habitat, which increases the chance of interaction between people and bears. Thus, habitat improvements (government or community-based reforestation) would be helpful in alleviating such conflicts. Potential solutions to this problem have not been studied in depth and further research on this issue is critical to getting this problem under control. The planting of fruit trees, to provide both food and cover, has been undertaken in several states in India.<br/> <br/> Other projects to help ameliorate human-bear conflicts will probably need to be implemented for a number of years to produce useful outcomes; long-term funding will thus be needed to advance the science of human-bear conflict resolution. Where sufficient human resources and funding exist, conflict rapid-response teams (staffed by NGOs, government personnel, and local people) can be effective. Safety guidelines can be devised and disseminated, based on knowledge of bear behaviour and ecology, to help people avoid bears or minimize chances of being attacked. Better methods to deter bears are also needed. Additionally, educational efforts to increase awareness and promote greater tolerance are likely to be keys to success.<br/> <br/> Aside from the global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species, published by the IUCN in 1999 (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), India developed a National Conservation Action Plan for bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). This action plan was developed through a wide range of consultations with stakeholders and covers all four species present in India. The plan emphasizes mitigation of human-bear conflicts, increased habitat management, enhanced research and information gathering, capacity building, and improved communication and education. Priority actions in the action plan include: strengthening methods of crop and livestock protection; reducing bear-caused human injuries, creating rapid response teams to investigate conflicts with bears (and possible claims for monetary compensation); enhancing human tolerance toward bears; identifying critical habitats and corridors used by bears, especially those outside PAs; increasing habitat protection and restoring degraded habitats outside PAs; reducing dependency of local communities on resources needed by bears; discouraging shifting agriculture; developing methods to track population size and trends; involving communities in bear monitoring programs; equipping forest and wildlife staff with adequate knowledge and modern equipment to manage all types of human-bear interactions; and developing an advocacy program for bear conservation through active communication to the public and pressure on corporations and politicians.</p>",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

Together with fuelwood-collection and commercial timber extraction, this is rapidly fragmenting suitable habitat, even within protected areas, where enforcement of regulations is often absent or impossible. Hunting for food is the other major threat, particularly in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, where large-scale snaring of pheasants and partridges by local people is an increasing problem. The population in Arunachal Pradesh is under threat from hydroelectric project developments, and associated road-building and residential expansion (A. Rahmani <em>in litt.</em> 2012). <span class=""msoins0"">In Myanmar there is evidence of hunting on a limited scale but this is not a main target species compared with large game such as wild boar, deer or monkeys. The continuing upward expansion of shifting cultivation for hill rice, using slash-and-burn methods is a long term threat. Increases in secondary growth forest and scrub following fires also limits suitable habitat, whilst human encroachment threatens isolated patches of the species's habitat (Wang 2014). In Bhutan, high levels of grazing and slash-and-burn agriculture are also potentially significant problems. In Nagaland, the species is protected through customary conservation laws enforced by indigenous tribal groups. &#160;Despite the law, the bird is often hunted for meat during traditional festivals. It is also hunted routinely, perhaps because of the inadequacy of protein substitutes and non-availability of markets (A.

The cause of these reductions are unclear. As such, Malabar Grey Hornbill is assessed as Vulnerable under Criterion A2bc + A3bc + A4bc.","It is common in the tropical wet evergreen forests and moist forests of the Western Ghats (Balasubramanian <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mudappa and Raman 2009). Within the moist forest tracts, it also occurs in home gardens, timber plantations, shade coffee and cardamom plantations, particularly where they adjoin forests (Raman 2006, Sidhu<em> et al. </em>2010).&#160;<br/><br/>The breeding season extends from February to May in the Nilgiris and Anamalai Hills, Western Ghats (Mudappa 2000, Maheswaran 2002). In tropical wet evergreen forests of the Anamalai Hills, the hornbill was recorded nesting in 13 tree species such as <em>Alseodaphne semecarpifolia</em>,<em> Hopea parviflora</em>,<em> Aglaia roxbhurghiana</em>,<em> Artocarpus sp</em>.,<em> </em>and <em>Mimusops elengi</em>, selecting nest trees of significantly larger diameter at breast height (DBH 60-89 cm), and greater height of the lowest branch than random trees (Mudappa and&#160;Kannan 1997, Mudappa 1998).Tropical semi-evergreen forest of Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, nests were located in 19 tree species (over two-thirds of the nests were in <em>Lagerstroemia microcarpa</em>,<em> Terminalia bellirica </em>and <em>T. crenulata</em>) and in large trees (mean height = 36 ± 6 m, girth at breast height = 3 ± 1 m, nest height = 17 ± 6 m; Balasubramanian and&#160;Maheswaran [2002], Maheswaran &amp; Balasubramanian [2003]).&#160; Nests were also observed in non-native trees like <em>Eucalyptus</em> and <em>Grevillea</em>. A clutch of 4 eggs are laid. Incubation period is about 40 days and fledgling period is 46 days (Mudappa 2000). About 5% of the nests were reported to become annually defunct due to change in nest entrance, fire, treefall etc. (Mudappa 2005).&#160;Fruits of liana species (and some shrubs), especially species in the plant families Lauraceae, Moraceae, Annonaceae, and Euphorbiaceae are consumed during breeding and non-breeding season (Mudappa 2000, Balasubramanian and&#160;Maheswaran 2002). This species also consumed animal matter during the breeding season (Mudappa 2000). Large flocks (up to 20) are sometimes noticed in coffee plantations, where shade trees such as <em>Ficus</em> spp. and&#160; <em>Maesopsis emenii </em>(non-native) offer fruits consumed by the hornbills.","Deforestation driven by agricultural conversion in the northern part of the range is thought to be driving some declines in the species's population in this region (Kemp and&#160;Boesman 2019, Mudappa and&#160;Raman 2020), and the availability of large trees with suitable nesting cavities may be limiting (Mudappa and&#160;Raman 2020). Fragmentation of forest also affects the species (Raman and&#160;Mudappa 2003).<br/><br/>However, declines in density have occurred within protected areas, where there does not appear to have been a significant habitat change, which indicates that further research is required to identify plausible drivers of the decline. Potential threats may come from an undocumented shift in range for a competitor or predator, undetected disease affecting either the individuals of this species or limiting resources, or changed agricultural practice with an as yet undocumented impact on the species.","The overall global population size has not been quantified, but the species is a generally common and widely distributed species along the Western Ghats, most frequent at mid-elevations (Mudappa and Raman 2009). Highest densities were found in Reserved Forests, but the species was frequent throughout, especially in moist forest. However, recent population estimates and indices in comparison with available historical data suggest a significant and rapid decline, both locally and range-wide (D. Mudappa and&#160;T. R. S. Raman <em>in litt. </em>2020).<br/><p>During 2004-5, biologists estimated relative abundance (Balasubramanian&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004) and population density (Mudappa and&#160;Raman 2009) from number of wildlife along the Western Ghats (Balasubramanian&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Mudappa and&#160;Raman 2009). Significant populations were reported in moist forest habitats and mid-elevations (600-1100 m) in Agasthyamalai and Anamalai Hills, and the Periyar landscape in the southern Western Ghats (Mudappa and&#160;Raman 2009). Density estimates from a more northern location in Anshi – Dandeli – Goa landscape (9.4 individuals/km², 95% Confidence Interval = 6.1 – 14.4) were lower than in the southern Western Ghats (Mudappa and&#160;Raman 2009).&#160;</p><p>In the Anamalai – Parambikulam landscape of the southern Western Ghats, line transect surveys during 2004-5 estimated a mean density of Malabar Grey Hornbills of 67.4 individuals/km² (95% CI =40.4 – 94.4 individuals/km²) in Reserved Forests, 28.5 individuals/km² (CI = 23.9 – 33.1) in Wildlife Sanctuaries (now Tiger Reserves), and 26.0 individuals/km² (CI = 18.6 – 33.4) in rainforest fragments on the Valparai Plateau (Mudappa and&#160;Raman 2009). Within the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, the mean density of Malabar Grey Hornbill was higher in three sites at middle elevations (700–1,000 m): Anaigundi Shola (42.7 individuals/km²), Karian Shola (48.7 individuals/km²), and Varagaliar–Manamboli–Sheikalmudi complex (40.8 individuals/km²), and broadly similar across rainforest fragments within plantations on the Valparai Plateau (21.5–33.5 individuals/km²) according to Mudappa and&#160;Raman (2009).&#160;&#160;</p><p>Comparable estimates for the Anamalai landscape from 2017-8 (P.

For example, the species is now considered extinct in Bangladesh, and in India the species is generally not found outside protected areas except for in a few forest reserves. This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or higher over the next three generations or 40 years. The species is likely to face increasing threat of population decline from the ongoing and projected threats from increasing habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation due to infrastructure development, new settlements, expanding monocultures, and slash-and-burn cultivation, from hunting for consumption and the traditional medicine industry, and from isolation stresses. Nationally, in Thailand this species is listed as Endangered.<br/><span lang=""ES-TRAD""></p>","This species ranges from tropical semi-evergreen forest to tropical wet evergreen forest and tropical moist deciduous forest (Chetry 2020). It prefers dense tropical semi evergreen forests (Chetry 2002, Choudhury 2001), but can persist in disturb secondary forests and those adjoining human-modified habitats. Srivastava and Mohnot (2001) report it from lowland semi evergreen forests to monsoon and montane forests. In India, it occurs at elevations of 50–1,300 m (Chetry 2002; Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003; Choudhury 2001, 2002; Srivastava and Mohnot 2001), between 200 and 2,200 m in Myanmar (Htun pers. comm.), and up to 2,400 m in China (X. Jiang pers. comm.). In Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia it is predominantly found above 400 m, while in karst limestone environments it is found in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). Climate varies from tropical to subtropical across this macaque's distribution. The species is good swimmer, but is terrestrial and diurnal. It spends 73-83% of its time on ground for feeding (Chetry 2002), where it feeds primarily on seeds, fruits, flowers, stem cortex, bulbs, shoots rhizomes, roots and to lesser extent on young and mature leaves, small vertebrates and insects. It will also raid crops for potatoes, sweet potatoes, turnips and rice. This species has a generation length of 10–12 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). It occurs widely in the hill and mountain areas of Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). In Thailand, it is widespread but discontinuous, in forests associated with limestone hills and outcrops, and other forest habitats (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). In China, it is found in broadleaved evergreen forests, and sometimes in secondary forests close to farmlands (X. Jiang pers. comm).<br/><br/>Long-term study in India reported that the species consumes 23.65% of time feeding on seeds, 21.81% on fruits, 14.22% on leaves and twigs, and 10.35% on roots and tubers. Moreover, they spent 8.09% of their time feeding on bamboo shoots, and 7.79% feeding other minor food items (Chetry and Chetry 2015).<br/><br/>Stump-tailed Macaque is very selective over the lodging trees. In India, it has been found to use only six species of tree for lodging: <em>Artocarpus chama</em>, <em>Ficus bengalensis</em>, <em>Castopnopsis indica</em>, <em>Ficus religiosa</em>, <em>Mangifera sylvatia</em> and <em>Ficus benjamina</em> (Chetry and Bhattacharjee 2004, Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Home range, as measured in Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary (Assam, India), ranges from 387 to 587 ha, and day travel ranges from 90 to 4.5 km (Chetry 2002, Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2007, Chetry and Chetry 2020). Daily movement differs from one place to another: for example, in Yunnan, China daily ranges are 2–3 km. Group size can be as small as 2-3 individuals or as large as 60 individuals.","<p>Habitat disturbances affecting this species' survival include selective logging, timber and firewood collection for charcoal, building roads, dams, power lines and fisheries, deliberately setting fires, fragmentation, and soil loss/erosion. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food, and live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species is hunted as a pest in Khasi and Garo hill in “Paan Jhum” area in Northeast India (Srivastava 1999, Chetry and Chetry 2020).<br/><br/>In India, much of its habitat is affected by Jhum cultivation (shifting or slash-and-burn agriculture; Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). It has also been indiscriminately hunted over almost its entire distribution in India (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). Its vulnerability to hunting is due to its large body size and terrestrial habit (Chetry and Chetry 2020, D. Chetry and J. Das pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is heavily targeted for use in traditional “medicine,” both nationally and for trade with China. Agriculture, hydropower and mining developments are the other threats that need to be watched.<br/><br/>Within Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting levels for food and for trade are also very high. Habitat loss is a relatively lower threat compared to hunting (R. Timmins pers. comm.), but increasing fragmentation is expected with ongoing and future planned hydropower projects (and associated road access, power lines, and timber extraction).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, where Stump-tailed Macaques are found only in three of 24 sites, concession mining and land mining are existing threats even in protected areas.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, the species suffers from opportunistic hunting in their area of occurrence across the country for supply of bones for “medicinal” use in Viet Nam and China is threatening the population. Logging, gold mining and shifting cultivation are accounted as some direct threats. Other threats include extensive poaching and earlier were used in manufacturing polio medicine. Poaching for traditional medicine is still on unabated and therefore pressing the remaining population. Absence of any new conservation measure is in not helping the situation either.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, logging and timber extraction are major threats. Commercial rubber plantations, hunting, and trade of animal parts with China are all major threats to this species. In China, hunting and habitat loss have reduced in population of this species, and it is locally extinct in some places. Over hunting might have extirpated the population in Guangdong Province. Habitat loss from plundering of evergreen broad leaf forest is a serious threat. In Thailand, habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation are major threats, while hunting is prevalent, but not a significant threat to the species (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). Until 1976, until the ban on international trade in 1976 of primates, trade and export of Stump-tailed Macaque was well and active. The United States of America alone imported ca 30,000 primates from Thailand, mostly macaques, for use in biomedical research and some were famously sold as ‘miniature chimpanzees’. The population in peninsular Thailand was thus significantly reduced due to this trapping for trade and export.<br/></p>","Populations of this species are critically threatened in India, declining in Myanmar and Viet Nam, probably stable in China, and the species is listed as Endangered in Thailand. There are some declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia. Future declines are predicted to be faster in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, India, Myanmar and China due to habitat loss and/or hunting. Populations in South Asia and in Myanmar are few and are fragmented (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, S.Htun pers. comm.). This species is suspected to be extinct in Bangladesh, having last been recorded there in 1989 (M. Feeroz pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The population is declining rapidly in India except in the few protected areas; in fact, the species is extirpated outside the protected areas except in few reserve forests (D. Chetry and J. Das pers. comm). It is very scarce all over its range in northeastern India. It was previously reported as common in the mountains of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram&#160; and Tripura but currently only found in few isolated locations (Chetry 2002,Choudhury 2001). In India, it is found in the following protected areas:&#160; Arunachal Pradesh, Namdapha National Park, Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary, Assam-Barail Wildlife Sanctuary and Reserved Forest, Innerline Reserved Forest, Hollongapar Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, Meghalaya-Balpakram National Park, Nokrek National Park, Narpuh wildlife Sanctuary, Mizoram-Murlen National Park, Phawngpui Nationa Park, Dampa Tiger Reserve, and Lengteng Wildlife Sanctuary (Chetry 2018, Chetry and Chetry 2020, Chetry 2002, Choudhury 2002, J. Das and D. Chetry pers. comm.). In India, &lt;1,000 individual are estimated on the south bank of the river Brahmaputra and east of Dibang River in northeast India; the species is critical in India (D. Chetry and J. Das pers. comm). In China, the species is still common in western Yunnan, though the populations are thought to be lower in the eastern portions of its range, but recent record suggest that there is still existence of the species in Bangladesh (Dr. Md. Farid Ahsan pers. com.). In 2015, 23,000 individuals were estimated in China’s National survey on mammal populations (Long and Jiang pers. comm), albeit in several fragmented subpopulations. Li <em>et al</em>. (2018) estimated ~3,700 individuals. The population of this species should be larger than 3,700 in China (Pengfei Fan pers. comm.). In many places, populations have gone extinct locally (Chang pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There are no available population estimates for this taxon in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). The population is probably large as the species is frequently encountered throughout its distribution in these countries, although populations are mostly fragmented and isolated.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in Cambodia, southwestern China [Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Fujian and Yunnan provinces (Li <em>et al</em>. 2018)], northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura states), Lao PDR, northwestern Peninsular Malaysia (Perlis), northern Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. It appears that some occur on the border between Tripura and Chittagong Hill Tracks as confirmed in February 2016. The macaques were on the both sides of the border. Once widespread, the species in Thailand currently persists in a few isolated locations in the western, central and southern parts of the country (Treesucon 1988, Malaivijitnond and Hamada 2005). Formerly it was also found in eastern Bangladesh, but the species has vanished from most parts of its former range in Bangladesh. In China, it is found south of 25°N. The species has been introduced to Hong Kong. In northeastern India, it was long believed to be restricted to the south bank of the Brahmaputra River (Choudhury 1988, Chetry 2002). The Namdapha–Kamlang landscape is also on the south/east bank of the Brahmaputra and is a known stronghold of the species. However, it is to be seen whether it occurs north of the Lohit River, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra from where there are unconfirmed reports. Srivastava and Mohnot (2001), J. Das (pers. comm.) and Chetry <em>et al</em>. (2003) report possible records of this species from Namdapha National Park, though they were morphologically distinct from other representatives of the species, and could represent an undescribed subspecies. Introduced in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>It is suspected that its area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are undergoing rapid decline due to ongoing and planned infrastructure development, which is causing habitat degradation and loss. For example, in Perlis (Malaysia), there has been a 24% decrease in tree cover since the year 2000 (Global Forest Watch 2020).<br/></p>","The species is hunted for food (subsistence and exotic), traditional medicine industry, pet trade, and sport, cultural and traditional hunting.",Terrestrial,"<p>Internationally, this species is listed under Appendix II in CITES.

Therefore, it is suspected that a decline by 30% has continued during the last three generations. </li><li><em>Ovis v. punjabensis</em> – Vulnerable (A2bcd). The total population is believed to be less than 800 individuals (less than 480 mature individuals); the population decline over the last three generations it believed being 30% or more. </li><li><em>Ovis v. vignei</em> – Vulnerable (A2bcd). The total population is believed to be approx. 1,800 individuals (less than 1,080 mature individuals), including the population in northeastern Afghanistan; the population decline over the last three generations is believed being 30% or more.</li></ul><p></p>","<p>Urials inhabit moderately to very arid habitats at an altitude range from below the sea level in the Trans-Caspian lowlands to above 4,000 m a.s.l. in the Pamirs, Hindu Kush and Himalayas. They prefer hills, undulating terrain and gentle slopes, but also use cliffs. Urials occur in grasslands and open woodlands, e.g., of almond<em> Amygdalus sp.</em>, pistachio <em>Pistacia</em> <em>sp. </em>and juniper <em>Juniperus sp.</em>, as well as cold deserts with scarce vegetation dominated by subshrubs. Urial may also forage at crop fields. They use cavities in slopes or cliffs for shelter or rest under shrubs. <br/><br/>Urial are gregarious with group sizes reaching more than hundred individuals, where local population sizes is sufficiently large. The average Urial group size in Golestan National Park, Iran with over 4,000 individuals was around 29 individuals (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Urial densities were higher (21.77 vs. 0.15 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) near ranger stations, which provide protection from poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Herds are smaller and often sexually segregated during spring and summer. They are sexually dimorphic, non-territorial and promiscuous. The reproductive cycle begins with the rut in late November. Females give birth to one or less often two lambs (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2019) in April-June. Rut and lambing periods vary between different parts of the range. Main predators are large felid and canid carnivores and occasionally golden eagle on lambs (Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016). Females typically give first birth after two years, males are sexually mature at three years, but are fully mature at eight years. Maximum lifespan in the wild is 11 years (Baskin and Danell 2003). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal</em><br/></strong>The plateau Ustyurt and Mangyshlak peninsula represent clay deserts at elevations of 150-175 m asl. The climate is sharply continental. Sheep inhabit clay and Cretaceous cliffs (“chinks”) and ravines or hill slopes of a different steepness. Males prefer more open parts of a relief whereas females and young animals are attracted to the broken relief (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>Habitats of the Tajik Urial are characterized by aridity and continental climate. This subspecies occurs at altitudes between 500 and 2,200 m asl. It prefers the pistachio woodlands or other shrubs located on hilly watersheds of low ridges with obligatory presence of deep gorges with steep slopes (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>Afghan Urial usually use rounded, broken mountain terrain, plateau, gentle slopes and hills with gorges and at lower altitudes between 600 and 2,500 m, in southern Pakistan below 1,200 m asl but readily access precipitous terrain as escape cover. Most habitats are open woodlands with some shrub vegetation, but they occur as well in degraded habitats (Groves and Leslie 2011, Fedosenko 2002). In the Hazarajat, Afghanistan, local people have indicated that Urials appear to remain permanently within some specific areas and move throughout these with predictable seasonal migrations. There are two major migrations – one into the lambing areas in late May and one into the rutting area in mid-November. Rutting behaviour occurs from mid-December to mid-January (WCS Afghanistan 2014; <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em><br/></strong>The habitat of Punjab Urial is the scrub forest in Salt and Kala Chitta Ranges. In the Salt Range it is typically associated with lower rounded stony hills sparsely covered with wild olive <em>Olea ferruginea</em> and phulai <em>Acacia modesta</em>. The distribution of the subspecies in Pakistan is between the Indus and Jhelum rivers at elevations of 250-1,500&#160;m. The reproductive cycle begins with the rut in mid-October and November with a peak of activity in the first half of November. Females give birth to one or two lambs in early April. Main predators are leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> and jackal <em>Canis aureus</em>. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>The habitats of this form are relatively gentle slopes at high altitudes of more than 2,500 m, up to 4,000 m asl. and more, characterized by aridness, severity of climate and semi-desert vegetation with scarce forage and almost complete lack of shrubs (Fedosenko 2002, Siraj-Ud-Din <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Ladakh, Urial primarily use rolling and moderately steep slopes along the lower portion of the Indus and Shyok valleys, rarely using the steeper mid and higher elevation areas occupied by ibex and blue sheep (Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2010). Increasingly however, Urials seem to be taking refuge in possibly suboptimal steep areas in the lower valleys as the gentler ones are coming under different land use (Raghavan <em>et al</em>. 2003, Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006).</p>","<p>Overall, this species is threatened mainly by poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a, 2019), competition with livestock on forage, space and disease spillover risk and predation of lambs by shepherd dogs. Urials avoid rugged mountainous terrain where it might gain some protection, and is thus particularly prone to poaching, competes for food directly with livestock that seasonally shares its habitat and is threatened by infectious diseases transmitted by sheep and goats. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal</em><br/></strong>Poaching was the cause of the latest decline in the ex-Soviet republics. It was carried out by locals, especially around the limited waterholes used by the Urial, using both firearms and snares (Fedosenko 1986, Gorbunov 1986). Fedosenko and Weinberg (1999) reported excessive (trophy) hunting and intensive livestock grazing as threats in the Northern Aktau (Kazakhstan). In the Aktau-Buzachin Nature Reserve, Kazakhstan, Frisina (2002) found that historical overgrazing, which had ceased about ten years before his survey has caused serious habitat degradation, still affected the condition of the Urial. Given recovery of the livestock numbers in Kazakhstan (see <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TA"">http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TA</a>) a serious risk of increasing overgrazing can be assumed. During the last two decades, poaching became more and more common, with the growth of extractive industries in the Mangystau Province and people having access to modern firearms and off-road vehicles as well as drones, which are used for detecting and chasing Urials in the narrow cliffs they inhabit. Extractive industries with road development and seismic exploration cause habitat fragmentation and disturbance.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>The decrease in numbers is attributed to commercial hunting during the Soviet Union, poaching and competition with domestic livestock, coupled with droughts and severe winters. Some key habitats in Babatag and Hazratishoh have been affected by the civil war in Tajikistan (1992-1997) when poaching was totally uncontrolled. Poaching had also been attributed to border violations from Afghanistan (Michel, 2010). Newborn lambs are captured as pets but the impact on the population is not known. In Tajikistan, Urial have been kept in a large enclosure together with European mouflons <em>O. aries</em> (media reports, R. Muratov, pers. comm. 2018), thus potentially risking hybridization and in case of escapes genetic pollution of the wild population.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, poaching of Urial is reported to be still commonplace in the Urial habitat. Some Urials also become habituated to grazing barley fields and are shot (WCS Afghanistan 2014, <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). Capture of lambs indicated the existence of a Urial population east of Kabul in 2015. In Iran, the main threat to ungulates is rampant poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Poaching usually happens by local communities or by people from bigger cities with the guidance of locals. The main incentives for poaching in Golestan National Park have been identified as subsistence, pleasure, tradition, trade of wild meat, and conflict with conservation regulations and bodies (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Disease transmitted by livestock could also be of serious threat to Urials. In 2011, Peste des Petits Ruminants virus was the suspected cause of 550-700 deaths among Urial in Sarigol National Park (Marashi <em>et al</em>. 2017). Other threats such as habitat loss, competition with livestock, diseases and climate change are of importance for this species in Iran. In Pakistan, poaching, livestock overgrazing, and habitat degradation caused by fuelwood gathering and by agriculture, are the main threats to this Urial. Afghan Urial may be more susceptible to such threats than are wild goats <em>Capra sp.</em> inhabiting the same areas because of species-specific differences in habitat preferences (Edge and Olson-Edge 1987). Throughout its range in Baluchistan, Urial faces severe poaching pressure and competition from domestic sheep and goat, and lives in extremely scattered and small populations (Virk 1991). In Turkmenistan, poaching is the main threat but there is also competition from domestic livestock for forage and water (Annabayramov 2011, Kaczensky and Linnell 2015, E. Rustamov, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabensis</em><br/></strong>The main threats for Punjab Uial are poaching, decline of habitat area because of agriculture, urbanization, roads and other human developments and loss of habitat in quality because of overgrazing by domestic livestock (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Arshad and Hussain 2018). Lambs are illegally taken at birth to be kept as pets (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006) and in some areas almost 50% of the lambs are collected by poachers within one week of parturition (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2015). They are a status symbol and although capture is illegal, the Pakistani government had been selling licences to keep Urial as pets (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2015) but it is not clear if this practice continues (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2015) Some are hybridized with domestic sheep. Adult rams are poached for their trophy value. Apart from the protected population in the Kalabagh Game Reserve, the Punjab Urial suffers heavy poaching pressure and the remaining range of this species is under continuously increasing human pressure (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, forage competition and transmission of diseases from domestic animals are major threats. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>In the Wakhan and adjacent areas in Afghanistan poaching by local people is limited thanks to conservation efforts and customary hunting rules (S. Michel, own observations and stakeholder interviews 2008-2013). Poaching is currently on the rise in Afghanistan due to militarization of the area related to border guard deployment as a result of growing insecurity in Badakhshan Province (S. Ostrowksi, pers. comm. 2019). Community rangers in Wakhan have also reported that shepherd dogs are a danger to Urials during lambing season. Opportunistic poaching on Urials moving to Tajikistan may prevent recolonization there. Hunting is banned in India and has been relatively strictly controlled recently (especially in the Indus valley), but the Urial’s habitat is highly accessible and susceptible to overuse by livestock herding and other human activities (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006, Raghavan <em>et al</em>. 2003). Urials occupy the low, relatively accessible areas along the major valley corridors, all of which have, or soon will have, roads and expanding human settlements. The resulting effects of increased poaching and eventual human settlement associated with irrigation projects and increased livestock numbers will require effective conservation and management actions if Ladakh Urial is to survive (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1994, Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2018) reported that poaching by locals and security forces seems to be relatively common in Kargil. In Pakistan, most Urial habitat is close to human settlements and also not very steep, therefore easily accessible to poachers and for grazing by increasing numbers of livestock leading to widespread habitat degradation and displacement of Urial into marginal habitat (Siraj-Ud-Din <em>et al.</em> 2016). Compared to the highly priced markhor <em>Capra falconeri</em>, which is more numerous in several areas, Urial received less attention in community-based conservancies and authorities in Pakistan are reluctant to authorize regulated trophy hunting of Ladakh Urial because of its rarity and concerns over the engagement and capacity of beneficiary communities to protect the species (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020). In general, small size and high fragmentation of Urial populations may seriously impact their survival in India and Pakistan (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006).</span></p>","<p>The global population of this species might be in the range of 30,000 animals. The population numbers do not include suspected species hybrids between <em>O. gmelini </em>and <em>O. vignei</em>, occurring in Iran. Hereby, we considered entire provinces if not otherwise indicated. The population trend across its range is likely to be decreasing, probably as much as 30% over three generations.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arabica</em><br/></strong>No information is available about this population and if it is still extant.<em> <br/><br/><strong>Ovis vignei arkal</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>The total number estimated in ex-Soviet republics at the beginning of the 1990s was ca. 6,000 animals (Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997). Numbers had declined sharply before the mid-1960s, when 3,000 were estimated for Kazakhstan, and continued to decline to 2,000 by the 1970s and 1,500 at the beginning of the 1980s (Lankin 1982; Savinov and Bekenov 1977). However, since the early 1990s the populations appear to have temporarily increased but more recently once more declined (see below paras about Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan). <br/><br/>In Kazakhstan, 130 urials were counted in the Karagiye Depression and 869 at the mesas of Northern Aktau in 1997 (Fedosenko and Weinberg 1999). In the Aktau-Buzachin Nature Reserve in Kazakhstan, during a survey in 2000 a total of 491 urials were observed, a density of 4 per km² in suitable habitat and providing the basis for an estimated population size of ~1400 animals (Frisina 2002). The Red Book of Kazakhstan (Bekenov, Kasabekov 2010) provided the following figures, indicating a massive decline: 1991 (5,500-5,600); 2000 (3,500);<span lang=""EN-US""> 2002 (2,000-2,500); and 2007 (700-1,000). In the protected areas, which cover most of the current habitat of the species, estimates in 2016 and 2017 yielded 1,354 and 1,514 animals, respectively, with the largest populations in Ustyurt State Strict Nature Reserve and in the Zhabayushkan reserve (Institute of Zoology, 2017). Similarly, the authorities of Mangystau Province for 2018 reported 1,550 animals. Local sources indicate, however, substantial local declines and extinctions. N. Ismailov (pers. comm., 2019) guessed a population of around 2,500 animals across the range in Kazakhstan in 2000 and suggested declines by more than 70% during the last 20 years (<em>ca</em> 1,150 in 2018/2019). <br/><br/>We present here all available population information for Iran under <em>O. v. cycloceros</em>, following Fedosenko (2002), who included all urials in Iran in this subspecies but considered only urials in Kazakhstan and northwestern Turkmenistan as <em>O. v. arkal</em>. <br/><br/>In the early 1980s, 800 were estimated in Turkmenistan, of which 500 were found along the shores of Kara-Bogaz Gol and 300 in the southern ravines (Zarkhidze 1983). Following protection resulting from its listing in the USSR Red Data Book, numbers of this subspecies began to increase in the latter half of the 1980s with some populations reestablishing themselves naturally. Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) reported 250 urials for the region of Kaplankyr and Kazakhly Shor and another 20 south of Kara-Bogaz-Gol, a substantial decline compared to 1,600 reported for the Turkmenistan part of the Ustyurt in the 1990s (Annabayramov 2011). <br/><br/>About 300 animals of this subspecies were thought to inhabit Uzbekistan in 1983 but numbers have since declined (O. Tsaruk, <em>in litt</em>. 1994), with ca. 40 near the border with Turkmenistan (B. Dyakin, pers. comm. to E. Mukhina 1995). In Uzbekistan, Central Asian Desert Initiative expeditions (2012-2014) recorded Urial&#160;observations, tracks and skulls north of Kazakhly Shor, northwest of Kaplankyr Strictly Protected Area, along the western shore of Sarykamysh Lake and northwest of it. Based on 52 direct observations and 72 individuals identified on camera traps overall numbers might be in the range of 100 animals (Marmazinskaya <em>et al.</em> 2016). <em><br/><br/><strong>Ovis vignei bochariensis</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Numbers have fluctuated slightly since the 1970s (Frolov and Golub 1983; Luzhevsky 1977), and by the late 1980s the total number estimated was only 1,000 animals (Prisyazhniuk 1990). However, Sokov (1993) mentioned &gt;1,000 for Tajikistan alone, so together with Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan there might have been up to some 1,200 animals. Numbers are believed to be decreasing, and in some areas, populations are very small. For example, in Uzbekistan on the western slopes of the Kugitangtau on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, there were as few as 100 individuals (B. Dyakin Department of Hunting Management, Uzbekistan pers. comm. to E. Mukhina), with only five counted in May 1993 in the Surkhan Nature Reserve (Chernogaev <em>et al.</em> 1995). Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) observed 36 animals at the Turkmenistan side of the mountain range, in Koytendag Strict Nature reserve. Numbers might have recovered since as Kholikov (pers. comm., 2014) in 2013 recorded 45 urials in Surkhan Strictly Protected Area in Uzbekistan. Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) assumes that about 250 urials exist at the Turkmenistan part of the mountain range. <br/><br/>In the Uzbekistan part of the Babatag Mountains at the border with Tajikistan in the early 2000s about 40 Bukhara urials were assumed to exist and Normatov (2016) mentioned that locals until around 2012 annually caught about 10 urial lambs as pets. Since then such information is missing, possibly indicating a massive decline in the population numbers. Urial is known from the nearby Aktau range in Tajikistan, which hosts a population of likely more than 100 urials (Michel, various local reports, own observations 2018). <br/><br/>For Tajikistan, the country with the largest population of the subspecies, reliable data on overall urial numbers in the past and present are not available. Figures for specific areas vary largely. Baskin and Daniell (2003) provide numbers ranging from 820 to 1,550 individuals for the three range areas Surkhkuh, Hazratishoh and Karatau. Surveys in the frame of the Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project since 2008 yielded much lower numbers (Garibmamadov and Amirov 2015, Michel 2014); most recent in 2014: Southern Hazratishoh Range 31, Panj Karatau 10 and Aktau 117 and Surkhkuh 16. Further animals are known from unsurveyed areas in Baljuvan and the Babatag Range in the immediate border region with Uzbekistan. The total population in Tajikistan is likely substantially below 500 animals. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan no numbers are available for the overall population or certain locations. Despite local people have indicated that Urial&#160;remain numerous in certain areas of the Hazarajat Plateau, discussions with hunters and other communities suggested a significant decrease in numbers and even their local extirpation (WCS Afghanistan 2014; Afghanistan.wcs.org, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/>In Iran, the population was estimated to be at least 20,000 animals in the mid-1970s (Valdez and DeForge 1985), of which around 10,000-15,000 were estimated to inhabit Golestan National Park alone (Kiabi 2004, Decker and Kowalski 1972). However, a scientific population assessment in 2013/2014 using line transects and Distance sampling in this national park showed around 66% decline in urial population compared to 1970s (4,275 individuals 95% confidence interval 2,117-8,632; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). A comparable or even more severe decline in the population of urial in a similar time window is anticipated for other protected areas (Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2019). The density of urial in Golestan National Park was around 12.57 individuals/km² (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Recent population estimates by Iranian Department of Environment from protected areas do not distinguish between urial, mouflon and hybrids. The total of figures from annual census by Department of Environment for the protected areas in the provinces with only <em>O. vignei</em> occurring (i.e., Golestan, North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Sistan and Baluchistan) in 2009 was approx. 13,000 and in the census of 2016 yielded around 18,000 individuals (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016). However, there may be more <em>O. vignei</em> populations in provinces of Kerman, Semnan, and Yazd adding up to around 11,000 additional urials to the total population (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016). However, due to the uncertainty in the presence of urial, hybrids with mouflon or both in these provinces, we refrain from reporting these numbers in the urial global population. <br/><br/>No total population census based on surveys is available for Pakistan. In the past, Roberts (1985) estimated that perhaps 2,500 to 3,000 Afghan urial lived in Baluchistan, with 1,000 (0.2/km²) inhabiting the Torghar hills of Toba Kakar range (District Zhob) according to Mitchell (1988), about 150 in the Takatu hills near Quetta (A. Ahmad, unpubl. Data), and more in the Dureji hills, District Zhob (Virk, 1991). Malik (1987) estimated a total of 310 to 340 Afghan urial for the whole of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (former North West Frontier Province (NWFP)), whereas the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) reported a total of only 80 urial (68 from Kohat, two from Mardan and 10 from Abbottabad), suggesting a severe decline over five years. For Sindh Province, a census carried out by Mirza and Asghar (1980) estimated a population of 430 urial for Kirthar National Park. Based on a census in the Mari-Lusar-Manghtar range and in the Karchat mountains in 1987, K. Bollmann (unpubl. data) estimated between 800 and 1,000 urial (0.26-0.32/km²) for the whole of Kirthar NP. About 150 to 200 animals lived in the Mari-Lusar-Manghtar range, and 100 to 150 in the Karchat mountains; i.e., 1.7 to 2.5 urial/km² (Edge and Olson-Edge, 1987). In Dureji Game Management Area, Baluchistan Province, Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2006) observed 504 urials and produced a population estimate of 858. During the fall survey 2008 Arshad and Khan (2009) estimated a population of 1,637 urials for the Torghar Conservation Project area, with substantial differences between high quality habitat (4.44/km²) and low quality areas (1.06/km²), and showing an overall decline, particularly in the buffer areas. In 2017, Shah Noorani Game Reserve in Baluchistan reported a population of 2,500 to 3,000 animals in 2016/2017. The Conservator Wildlife &amp; National Parks of Baluchistan, (A. Ali, pers. comm. 2019), reported for Hingol National Park and five community game reserves a total of 9,700 to 11,750 urial, with 3,000 in Torghar, but only 1,500 to 2,000 in Shah Noorani. An article on the website <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.tribune.com.pk"">www.tribune.com.pk</a> in January 2020 stated that 14,000 urials exist in protected areas in Sindh, including Halalo, Pachran, Uth Palan and Mol, but the figures could not be verified from official sources. <br/><br/>The estimate for the total population in Turkmenistan in the late 1980s and early 1990s was between 10,000 and 12,000 urials (Korshunov 1995). Numbers then had increased slightly from the estimates of 8,000 to 10,000 made in the 1970s (Babaev <em>et al.</em> 1978), when there were 2,000 in the Kopet-Dagh Reserve, with about 1,500 in the Badkhyz Reserve (Gorelov 1978). A significant decline in numbers was reported for the period until the late 1990s in the eastern Kopet Dagh and in Badkhyz, with only 150 to 200 in Big Balkhan and 300 to 350 in the western Kopet Dagh (V. Lukarevskiy, in lit., 1994); about 2500 – 2800 in the Eastern Kopet Dagh and about 3500 – 4000 for Turkmenistan in total, with a declining trend (Lukarevskiy <em>et al.</em> 2010). Rapid declines happened during the last decade, with Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) reporting an overall decline from around 4,000 in 2010 (Annabayramov 2011) to less than 1,600 and local declines by up to 60%. The larger share of these animals still occurs within protected areas, while outside of them urial exist mainly in relatively low densities. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em><br/></strong>Schaller (1977) estimated a total world population of ~2,000 Punjab urial and a complete census made in 1976-77 by Mirza <em>et al</em>. (1979) estimated 2,157. Estimates by Chaudhry (unpubl. data) in 1992, gave a minimum total population of 1,550 throughout its whole range. For Punjab, Chaudhry <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported a significant decline in urial numbers over only one year; from 733 in 1986 to 528 in 1987. A total of only 12 were reported for Chinji National Park (Chaudhry and Sarwar, 1988). Awan <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated a total population of about 860 urial in the Salt Range, suggesting a 56% decline from 1976, when Mirza <em>et al.</em> (1980) estimated 1,968 urial in the same area. Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2001) recorded 259 urials in Kalabagh Game Reserve in the Salt Range. Awan <em>et al.</em> (2006) found that this area was the last remaining stronghold for wild ungulates in the Punjab Province, while in neighboring unprotected areas in the Eastern Salt Range poaching, in particular of newborn lambs, caused a decline. Arshad and Hussain (2018) suggested some recovery in Jhelum District in Punjab, based on distance sampling of five sites in 2007, but did not estimate the population size. Khan <em>et al.</em> (2015) surveyed five sections of the Soan valley in the Salt Range and estimated a population of 110 urials (1.39/km²). A media article in November 2019 claimed that surveys revealed increases in the population of Punjab urial (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2093549/1-survey-punjabs-urial-population-completed/"">https://tribune.com.pk/story/2093549/1-survey-punjabs-urial-population-completed/</a>). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, the population in the Wakhan National Park might be attributed to this subspecies. The population in Wakhan was estimated stable between 2011 and 2015 and Moheb <em>et al.</em> (2012) recorded 400 urial there. However, results of sample counts carried out in 2018 may suggest a population decline compared to 2015 of as much as 30% (S. Ostrowski, pers comm. 2020). Simms <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported observations of 260 urials from the neighboring districts Ishkashim and Zebak. <br/><br/>The total population of <em>O. v. vignei</em> in India was previously estimated to be between 1,000 and 1,500 animals (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983, 1991), in a range spread over less than 2,000 km² (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). The Ladakh urial had declined dramatically in the last 60 years, especially during the military conflicts between 1947 and 1962 (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983). Raghavan <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the urial population in surveyed areas in Ladakh in 2002 to number around 690 (540-840) individuals. During a study in 2002-2003 in total 834 individuals were recorded (not including off-trail sightings). The Nindum-Fotula area, followed by Likir and Hemis Shukpachen had the highest proportion of urial sightings. As urial habitat overlaps with the areas of land use for livestock grazing, crop cultivation and infrastructure development, Raghavan <em>et al.</em> (2003) concluded that “it is unlikely that urial population in Ladakh is increasing. In fact, it seems more probable that they are actually facing, if not already on, a decline.” A recent survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2018) estimated 753 urial within 625 km² of surveyed area in Upper Shyam and Kargil landscapes. Density estimates from about 70 km² area in the Fotu La region of Kargil landscape had been nearly four times higher in 2003 (Raghavan <em>et al.</em> 2003), indicating that urial population may have suffered drastic decline in the areas bordering Kargil and Leh Districts. The Kargil and Upper Shyam landscapes seem to be supporting the last refuges of relatively large populations of urial in Ladakh currently. In rest of Leh and Kargil districts, urial was found to be scattered in small populations (Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>According to some reports from around 1900, <em>O. v. vignei</em> used to be a common animal of northern Pakistan. Schaller (1976) estimated that &lt; 1,000 were left in Pakistan and Roberts (1985) gave “intelligent guesses” of 500 to 600 animals for Baltistan and 700 to 800 for Gilgit-Hunza. All these estimates are much greater than more recent numbers. Hess (1990) estimated the total population of <em>O. v. vignei</em> in Pakistan for 1987-88 to be only 200 to 400 animals. In 1992, a total of 57 urial were estimated in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP, 1992); 29 in Dir and 28 in Chitral. The total estimated for the Gilgit-Baltistan (former Northern Areas) for 1993 was 400 to 500 urial (G. Tahir, Wildlife Wing, Northern Areas Forest Dept., in lit. to G. Rasool). Khan and Zahler (2004) saw only one herd of 13 animals and gathered reports on observations by local hunters and herders; they concluded that small scattered populations existed in southern Gilgit and Diamir districts. Siraj-ud-Din <em>et al.</em> (2016) from January to September 2013 in Gilgit-Baltistan recorded a directly observed minimum population of 172 individuals, and estimated the overall population comprising <em>ca</em> 432 individuals (4.79 urial/km²) taking into account local information as collected through questionnaires. They found the population being declining and have been extirpated from at least six previously known localities during the last decade. Surveys carried out by the Wildlife Conservation Society between winters 2018 and 2019 tallied minimal numbers ranging 62 to 146 in Bunji, where Siraj-ud-Din in 2013 had observed 109 animals, and 5 to 8 animals both in Nanga Parbat and Doyan. Information from other areas in Baltistan, Nagar and District Gilgit support less than 50 animals in total, but several areas have not been investigated for decades. Overall the remaining population of urial in Gilgit-Baltistan is likely less than 350 individuals in 2019 (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020).</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in Afghanistan, northwestern India (Ladakh), central and eastern Iran, southwestern Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Wild sheep reported from Oman (where it has possibly been introduced) have been considered as urial. In Iran, following Rezaei <em>et al</em>. (2010) (and unlike Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016 or Yusefi <em>et al</em>. 2019, which assigned the Ovis in all areas to either of the two species), we considered a zone of occurrence of hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em>. The exact extent of this hybrid zone and the status of certain populations of wild sheep there are uncertain. Therefore, we opted for the most conservative scenario at the province level (due to data limitations) and delineate the species boundaries accordingly. We considered the easternmost provinces (i.e., Golestan, North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Sistan and Baluchistan) as the 'confirmed' range of urial as we had higher certainty about urial presence. We suspect that, for example, Kerman or parts of Semnan provinces could also be included in urial range, but we opted for being more conservative as higher phenotypic diversity in wild sheep in these provinces is observable. Our tentative hybrid zone is also included in the description of the geographic range in this assessment and mapped as 'Presence Uncertain' with a note that there is a higher possibility of hybridization in this area.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arabica</em> (Arabian or Oman Urial)</strong><br/>There is no recent information available on the occurrence of wild sheep in the Jebal-Akhdar mountains in northern Oman, which had been attributed to urial (Fedosenko, 2002). This population is not mentioned by Damm and Franco (2014), it is unknown if it still exists and what its origin (autochthonous or introduced) had been (S. Ross, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal </em>(Ustyurt or Transcaspian Urial or Arkal)</strong><br/>The distribution range of this subspecies is not clearly delimitated from the range of <em>O. v. cycloceros</em>. Groves and Grubb (2011) merge both subspecies in one species, but distinguish two subspecies. They consider the urial in Turkmenistan and northeastern Iran as belonging to this subspecies. Other sources (e.g., Fedosenko 2002) distinguish the urial in the Large and Small Balkhan and Kopet-Dagh mountain ranges in Turkmenistan and further to the south in northeastern Iran as <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> and consider only the urial in the Ustyurt as <em>O. v. arkal</em>. Following the latter determination, the subspecies is found in southwest Kazakhstan, northwest Turkmenistan and northwest Uzbekistan (Karakalpakstan) where it inhabits the western part of the Ustyurt plateau north and east of Kara-Bogaz-Gol Gulf, including Kaplankyr Plateau, Kazakhly-Sor, the low mountains on the Mangyshlak Peninsula and other areas with cliffs and ravines in Mangystau Province. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>The Bukhara urial occurs in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is found north of the Amu Darya and Panj rivers, where it inhabits the Kugitang and Baisuntau mountains, the Babatagh, Aktau and Panj Karatau ranges, the Surkhkuh, the Vakhsh range on the east bank of the Vakhsh river and the Hazratishoh Range (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, urial populations were known to occur throughout the Hindu Kush and the mountains of central Afghanistan, extending from the Zebak mountains in the north to the Seyah Koh range in the southwest. Urial occurred in the Ajar Valley Reserve, from where animals were known to migrate into distant valleys near the Band-e Amir National Park (both in Bamiyan Province). Its presence was established in Zebak area during 1976 surveys, but it was not known how far the species ranged into Badakhshan Province. In the east of Kabul, the urial was found in the Kohe Safi region of Kapisa Province (Petocz 1973). Specimens collected from hunters show that its range extended towards the Lataband Pass area near Kabul. Pictures of two captured urial lambs, kept in Khak-e Jabbar and reports by local people confirmed that the species was still extant there in 2015 (A. Kh. Khaurin, pers. comm. 2017). Other photographed poached animals in 2015 also confirmed its presence in Takhar Province (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020). The subspecies was also reported from the Safed Koh range in Herat and Badghis Provinces. Wildlife Conservation Society surveys since 2006 have confirmed urial presence within the Bamyan Plateau bounded roughly by Band-e-Amir, Saighan, Ajar Valley, southern Samangan, southeastern Saripul and Yakawlang-Sulej, although numbers are very low or even absent altogether in parts of their previous range within Badakhshan and the eastern forests (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/>In Iran, this subspecies (often referred as subspecies <em>O. v. arkal</em>) occurs in rolling hills and on gentle mountain slopes in the eastern country. There are remarkable populations in protected areas of the northeastern country including Golestan National Park, Sarigol National Park, Serany Protected Area and Tandureh National Park (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2018, Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019, Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016, Yousefi <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>For Pakistan, a distribution map for urial in the North West Frontier Province (now Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) is given by Malik (1987), showing its scattered occurrence in the Districts of Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Northern Waziristan, Karak, Kohat, Orakzai, Kurram, Peshawar, Mardan, Abbottabad, and Swat. According to the report by Roberts (1985) in Baluchistan <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> were widely distributed up to 2,750 m on gentler slopes of the major mountain ranges. The Conservator Wildlife &amp; National Parks of Baluchistan confirmed urial occurrence in protected areas for Hingol National Park, and the community game reserves Torghar, Dureiji, Shah Noorani, Baran Lakh and Talo Band (A. Ali, pers. comm. 2019). In Sindh, the Afghan urial occurs in the Kirthar mountains, especially in the Mari-Mangthar range (District Karachi) and in Dumbar, Kambuh and Karchat mountains (District Dadu) (Virk 1991). <br/><br/>The subspecies is found in Turkmenistan, where its distribution stretches south-eastwards in scattered populations from the Large (about 39°40’N and 54°30’E) and Small Balkhan mountains north of Nebit-Dagh, through the Kopet-Dagh mountains, in the mountains on the right bank of the Tejen, in an area between the Kushka and Murgab rivers, and in the ravines and rolling hills of Namansaar, Yer Oilanduz (Badkhyz) as far east as Southern Karabil (about 36°20’N and 64°30’N) (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em></strong> <br/>The distribution area of this subspecies in Pakistan is enclosed by the Indus and the Jhelum rivers and the forest belt of the Himalayan foothills. The taxonomic status of urial living along the west bank of the Indus, adjacent to the Punjab urial’s range, is uncertain (Schaller and Mirza, 1974). The subspecies is found in small scattered populations in the Kala Chitta and in the Salt range in Punjab Province up to 1,500 m a.s.l. Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported 14 subpopulations in two areas: Kala Chitta Range (estimated area of occupancy 100 km²) and Salt Range (estimated area of occupancy 1,265 km²). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>The taxonomic status of the urial population recently reported in Wakhan, Ishkashim and Zebak districts of Badakhshan, Afghanistan (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2009, Simms <em>et al.</em> 2014) and Baroghil National Park, Pakistan (Khurshid Ali Shah, pers. comm. 2019), and until the early 2000s in the southern slopes of Shakhdara Range at the right bank of Panj River (southwestern part of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, Tajikistan) (Luzhevsky 1977; Sapozhnikov 1976) is uncertain. These populations form scattered groups, isolated from the range area of <em>O. v. bochariensis</em> and possibly also from the range of <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> in Afghanistan, but likely connected to urial populations in the very northern part of Pakistan (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>In India, this subspecies occurs only in the Union Territory of Ladakh (erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir Province), where it is distributed discontinuously in a narrow band along the valley-bottom, to the foothill boundary of the Indus and Shyok-Nubra rivers, and some of their major tributaries. Most urial are found along the Indus valley westward from the village of Likchey to that of Khalsi, with additional herds around the junction of the Nubra and Shyok valleys (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983, 1991), where they appeared to be restricted between Panamik and Diskit (Bhatnagar &amp; Wangchuk 2001). Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2018) found urial scattered in small patches across the Leh District mainly along the Indus River and in Shyok-Nubra valley primarily along the right bank Shyok and Nubra rivers, with scattered populations along their left bank. Further, in Kargil District, urial seemed missing across vast areas of potential habitat but distribution was highly clustered in Heniskot and Takmachik areas. One of the best areas for urial in Ladakh was the Nindum-Fotula area where herds of close to <em>ca.</em> 100 urial were reported (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). <br/><br/>In Pakistan, Schaller (1977) and Roberts (1985) gave the major river valleys of the Kunar, Chitral river, Indus, Gilgit river and Shyok as the main range of Ladakh urial. Ladakh urial is still widely distributed, mainly in Gilgit-Baltistan, but only in very small isolated populations. In Khyber-Pakhtunkwa, Chitral District, it still inhabited the right bank of the Kunar river, from Chitral southwards to Drosh (Anonymous, 1986). Localities on the east bank of the Kunar river, as well as from north of Chitral (Anonymous 1986; Zool. Surv. Dept., 1987) were not confirmed. Michel <em>et al.</em> (2009) quote reports from local people about urial presence in the upper Yarkhun Valley, close to the border with Afghanistan at Baroghil Pass. In Gilgit-Baltistan, Gilgit District, Hess (1990) was able to locate only one locality where urial survived in 1985-86; reliable informants indicated a population of around 27 animals on the right side of the lower Miatsil river (Hispar valley). Khan and Zahler (2004) confirmed the existence of small populations of Ladakh urial in southern Gilgit and Diamer districts Along with Siraj-ud-Din <em>et al.</em> (2016), which more recently confirmed the species’ presence mainly in Bunji, and also in Nanga Parbat, Nagar and Skardu areas. <br/><br/><strong><em>Hybrid populations</em><br/></strong>The hybrid population, Alborz red sheep (<em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em> x <em>Ovis vignei arkal/cycloceros</em>) (Valdez <em>et al</em>. 1978) occurs in north-central Iran in the Alborz Mountains in Tehran and Alborz provinces (Varjin Protected Area, Central Alborz Protected Area, Khojir National Park, Sorkheh Hesar National Park), east to the Parvar Protected Area and south into the Kavir National Park. The exact western, eastern and southern limits of its distribution are undetermined, but generally sheep in central Alborz Mountains are considered as belonging to this hybrid form. <br/><br/>The Kerman sheep occurring east of 55°E in the Khabr National Park and Baft mountains in Kerman Province has been suggested to be a hybrid population (<em>Ovis vignei cycloceros [blanfordti]</em> x <em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em>). (Valdez 2008).<br/><br/>Hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em> may occur also in other areas of Iran, including the provinces central and northern Fars, eastern Hormozgan, eastern Isfahan, Qom, eastern Semnan, and Yazd.</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Ovis vignei</em> has been listed on CITES Appendix I (<em>O. v. vignei</em>) and II (all other subspecies). Between COP 17 (2016) and COP 18 (2019) <em>O. vignei</em> had been listed in Appendix I as <em>O. aries vignei</em>, and in Appendix II as <em>Ovis aries </em>[except the subspecies included in Appendix I, the subspecies <em>O. a. isphahanica</em>, <em>O. a. laristanica</em>, <em>O. a. musimon</em> and <em>O. a. orientalis</em>, which are not included in the Appendices, and the domesticated form <em>O. a. aries</em>, which is not subject to the provisions of the Convention]). At CITES COP18 (2019) the Parties decided to divert from Wilson and Reeder 2005 and adopted as standard reference the taxonomy of the genus <em>Ovis</em> in Valdez and Weinberg (2011), leading to the listing of <em>O. vignei</em> as several species: <em>O. v. vignei</em> as <em>O. vignei</em> in Appendix I and all other subspecies as <em>O. arabica</em>, <em>O. arkal</em>, <em>O. bochariensis</em>, <em>O. cycloceros</em>, and <em>O. punjabiensis</em> (CITES 2020).<br/><br/>In Afghanistan, Urial reside seasonally or permanently in Bamyan Plateau Protected Area, Wakhan National Park and occasionally in Band-e Amir National Park and Wakhan National Park. So far, these protected areas are poorly enforced against poaching and unregulated livestock grazing. In Afghanistan, <em>O. vignei</em> was placed on the country’s first Protected Species List in 2009, prohibiting all hunting and trading of this species within the country. The Government of Afghanistan supported technically by the Wildlife Conservation Society continues to search for other currently unidentified populations of Urial, and is also beginning to put into place protection and enforcement measures around existing strongholds to ensure that Urial will continue to survive in Afghanistan (WCS Afghanistan 2014, <a href=""www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). Conservation measures implemented: 1) Extensive surveys of Urial populations and distributions in potential habitats and monitoring of populations in protected areas; 2) Involvement of local traditional hunters and other community members in protection activities as community rangers; 3) In Wakhan awareness raising on national and local regulations amongst communities and armed forces in the area; 4) Preventive vaccination of livestock against diseases transmissible to Urial in Wakhan National Park and Bamyan Plateau Protected Area; and 5) Support local communities in preventing damage to crops (e.g., protective measures, adapted selection of crops). In the future ecotourism, Urial viewing and hunting tourism could also be explored as sources of revenue for local people and incentive to protect the species.<br/><br/>In India, the Ladakh Urial is as a threatened species by the Government of India under its Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and its subsequent amendments. Hemis National Park (Ladakh) contains the only Urial population currently found in a protected area in India. Raghavan and Bhatnagar (2006) suggest that Ladakh has limited arable land, pasture, food and water resources that are shared between humans, livestock and wild animals. Therefore, people living in close contact with the wild animals are the primary stakeholders in any conservation and management action adopted for these animals. They propose the following conservation measures: 1) Research and monitoring with regard to Urial population, their ecology and rangeland use by Urial and livestock; 2) strict enforcement of the hunting ban, by improving effectiveness of protection staff; 3) Community-based conservation action, including active involvement of local people in conservation of Urial and its habitat, education, reduction of people’s dependence on pasture resources. Further, the country’s national landscape level, participatory conservation strategy, the Project Snow Leopard, will focus on Urial conservation outside wildlife protected areas too. Further, two new Wildlife Sanctuaries, Suru Valley Wildlife Sanctuary and Zanskar High Altitude Wildlife Sanctuary, are being set up in the Kargil district of the newly designated Union Territory of Ladakh, which will enhance Urial conservation in the country.<br/><br/>In Iran, Urial is a protected species that can be hunted under licences issued by the Department of the Environment. Unfortunately, the exact numbers of Urials shot each year by hunters are not available and differ substantially from year to year due to contrasting policies of promoting trophy hunting or blanket bans on all hunting according to change of leadership and conservation vision at the Department of Environment. When authorized by the DoE leadership hunting under a special licence is permitted in a number of protected areas (e.g., Heidary Protected Area). Urial occurs in several protected areas in Iran (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a; Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016; Yusefi <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, even so the government invests significantly at combating it, poaching prevails in most protected areas (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2016; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019) in spite of the hefty fines of around 1,785 Euro (i.e., 250,000,000 IRR; 1 Euro ~ 140,000 IRR 2020).<br/><br/>In Kazakhstan, Urial is listed in the Red Book and thus formally protected from any extractive use. The species is found in Ustyurt Strict Nature Reserve and in several reserves and provincial parks. In the area of the sacred site Beket-Ata Urial is traditionally protected from poaching and the animals are habituated to visitors. In the Aktau-Buzachin Reserve limited hunting based on a quota of annually 5 to 20 rams had been used as a source of funding for conservation activities (Fedosenko and Weinberg 1999). This quota seemed sustainable (Frisina 2002), but the program ended in the early 2000s and since then no legal hunting takes place in Kazakhstan. Discussions are ongoing, if the introduction of a legal hunting program, based on sound monitoring and conservatively set quotas, directly benefiting protected areas and local rural people might help to reduce poaching and to recover Urial numbers.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, Urial is a protected species, but permits for hunts in managed areas can be issued at provincial level. Several protected areas have mostly very small numbers of Urial and the level of effective protection is unclear. Managed game reserves have been effective in restoring and conserving of Urial including, e.g., Torghar (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2004, Arshad and Khan 2009) and Dureji (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2006) areas in Baluchistan (<em>O. v. cycloceros</em>), Kalabagh (Awan <em>et al</em>. 2006) in Punjab (<em>O. v. punjabensis</em>), and Bunji in Gilgit-Baltistan (<em>O. v. vignei</em>). Some of these areas not only prevent poaching but also prohibit or regulate livestock grazing, like Kalabagh Game Reserve (Awan <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Bunji Conservancy, the possibility of trophy hunting revenues play an incentive role to better protect the Ladakh urial, as it does for markhor. The main challenges are the vastness of an area difficult to control from outsiders, the large number of people and communities inhabiting the area and anticipated conflicts, and currently the lack of significant investment at protecting the species in anticipation of possible revenues from trophy hunting (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>In Tajikistan, Urial is legally protected as species listed in the Red Book. A limited number of permits is annually issued for trophy hunting. Urials occur in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve but had been under pressure from poaching there and in the adjacent areas. Also, other protected areas have limited effect in terms of protection of Urial from poaching and impact of livestock. The establishment of game management areas managed by communities or local family businesses where trophy hunting locally benefits Urial conservation and community well-being has potential to be expanded (Michel 2014). Breeding enclosures, as the one already established in Khatlon Province, may have rather adverse impact if they distract attention from the conservation of free ranging populations, are not attractive for responsible hunters and bear risks of inbreeding, disease and hybridizing with European Mouflon if kept in the same area.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, the three subspecies (<em>O. v. arkal,</em> <em>bochariensis </em>and <em>cycloceros</em>) are all listed under Category II of the national Red Book and thus legally protected. In the 1990s, Turkmenistan issued a limited number of permits for Urial hunts in the Kopet Dagh Mountains at USD 14,900 per animal (Weinberg, Valdez <em>et al</em>. 1997). Urial occurs in the Kaplankyr, Kopet Dagh, Siunt-Khasardag, Badhgyz and Koytendag Strict Nature Reserves.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Urial is protected due to its Red Book status. A small number of permits for trophy hunting is nevertheless issued and currently Urial hunts are offered on the internet. Urial (<em>O. v. bochariensis</em>) occur in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone in the Kugitang Mountain Range. The creation of additional protected areas in the Babatag and Baysuntau has been proposed. Uzbekistan plans the establishment of a strict nature reserve in the southern Ustyurt, benefiting the subspecies <em>O. v. arkal</em>. Protected areas’ effectiveness in preventing poaching and at least controlling livestock grazing needs to be improved.<br/></p>",Palearctic,,False,False,Global

Some major causes are jhum cultivation, monoculture plantations, timber and firewood harvests, and other development, resulting in the loss of fruiting and lodging trees. Also, these animals are subject to trade for their meat and other body parts, and as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>Encroachment, slash and burn shifting cultivation and fragmentation are the other threats. Hunting for meat is of serious concern in some parts of Assam, central and eastern Arunachal Pradesh, hill districts of Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram. They are also hunted their pelts which is used to make&#160;dao&#160;sheaths. Unsustainable bamboo harvest in Jagiroad, Panchgram and Jogighopa in Assam and Tuli in Nagaland.

Although sympatric with Hoolock Gibbons in South Asia, it is not as heavily impacted by the effects of habitat loss and is more adaptive, breeds more rapidly, and can move across fragments easily (A. Kumar and J. Das pers. comm.). However, the species has probably declined by more than 30% in the last 20 years, making it very vulnerable in its extremely fragmented locations (J. Das, A. Kumar and M. Singh pers. comm.; Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003) and it is predicted to decline at the same rate in the next 20 years (J. Das, A. Kumar and M.

A decline in both  range and abundance of &gt;30% over the last three generations (generation length = 7  years [Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013] x 3 = 21 years, 1999–2019) is  inferred due to a combination of direct exploitation and targeted  hunting, incidental mortality due to snares set for other species  (however any Mainland Clouded Leopard caught would likely enter trade),  and habitat loss. A recent study estimated a range-wide decline in the  area of habitat categorised as strongholds (defined as large contiguous  areas of habitat identified as high-quality from species distribution  models where the species could survive over the mid-to-long term) of 34%  between 2000 and 2018 (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2020a). Given that  Mainland Clouded Leopard populations are impacted by both hunting and  habitat loss, it is likely that actual population declines due to a  combination of habitat loss and overhunting may exceed this.<br/><br/>In  assessing the range-wide decline in Mainland Clouded Leopard since 1999,  we assume that 60% of the 1999 population occurred in Bangladesh,  Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, China, and Viet Nam, and that across these  countries the species’ population has declined by at least 45% over the  past 21 years (1.9% decline per year). We assume 15% of the 1999  population was in Malaysia and that this has experienced a 20% decline  since 1999 (0.9% per year) and 25% of the 1999 population was in  Thailand, India, Nepal, and Bhutan with a 10% decline (0.5% per year).  The assumptions above, in terms of percentage declines and percentage of  the 1999 population within different countries, were inferred based on  the expert opinion of the assessors. Overall, this results in a 32.5%  decline in abundance from 1999-2019 (3 generations) and an IUCN Listing  as Vulnerable under Criteria A2cd. As these threats are viewed as  unlikely to cease, and in some cases may not be reversible, future  declines are also suspected. Given the lower proportion of the 2019  population occurring in countries facing significant future declines  (e.g. Indochina, Myanmar) a future reduction of mature individuals  &gt;30% seems less likely and thus Criteria A3 is not triggered.  However, this situation may change if illegal wildlife trade expands to  other countries currently not as affected. Mainland Clouded Leopard does  qualify for Vulnerable under Criteria A4cd i.e. considering a 21-year time  period including both the past and future (e.g. 2010–2031).<br/><br/>Mainland Clouded  Leopard parts remain noted in trade with seizures and trade survey  records indicating that wild off-take (either targeted poaching or  through capture in indiscriminate hunting methods such as snares) is  likely causing declines in many populations. As a result of hunting  mortality and habitat loss, it is likely that Mainland Clouded Leopard  populations have declined by much more than 30% during 1999–2019 (three  generations) in at least Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam,  Bangladesh, and China. Populations of Mainland Clouded Leopard at the  beginning of 1999 were likely relatively large, and a significant  contribution to the global population, in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Lao  PDR. As such, declines in these countries are likely to have made a  strong contribution to range-wide declines. Whilst populations in Viet  Nam and China (see Geographic Range) also declined significantly during  the assessment period, the 1999 population in these countries was likely  comparatively small, and thus they would have made a less important  contribution to overall population decline. Declines in these six  countries are driven by a combination of targeted poaching for large  cats (particularly in Myanmar), habitat loss, and incidental capture in  snares (particularly in Indochina). Snaring has been implicated in  declines of many ground-dwelling forest dependent species throughout  Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam (Belecky and Gray 2020) including big  cats (Rasphone <em>et al.</em> 2019, Rostro-García <em>et al.</em> 2016) and  is likely to have impacted Mainland Clouded Leopard populations in all  three countries. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, the intensification of snaring  throughout forests and protected areas occurred during the assessment  period. For example, between 2010 and 2019 more than 195,000 snares were  removed by law enforcement patrol teams from Cambodia’s Cardamom  Rainforest Landscape (Belecky and Gray 2020)– an area which likely  supports one of a few remaining large Mainland Clouded Leopard  populations in Indochina.<br/><br/>Trends in Mainland Clouded Leopard  populations in the other range countries (Nepal, Bhutan, India,  Malaysia, and Thailand) are less clear. In Nepal, Bhutan, and India the  species largely occurs in relatively well managed protected areas which  are fairly secured from habitat loss and protected, to a degree, from  poaching. In Malaysia and Thailand, Mainland Clouded Leopard populations  likely face threats intermediate between those in Indochina and the  Indian sub-continent with intermediate levels of poaching and habitat  loss. However, there have been no published studies looking at changes  in Mainland Clouded Leopard density or abundance over time from anywhere  in the species’ range (which includes a number of high-profile Tiger  Reserves and Tiger Protected Areas).<br/><br/>Estimating the global population  of Mainland Clouded Leopard is difficult with little consistent  range-wide data however it is highly likely that there are fewer than  10,000 mature individuals. Published density estimates for the species,  from protected areas in the Indian Subcontinent, northern Myanmar,  Malaysia, and Thailand, vary between 0.3 and 5.14 mature individuals per  100 km² (Borah <em>et al.</em> 2014, Petersen <em>et al.</em>  2020b). There are no published density estimates from Cambodia, China,  Lao PDR, or Viet Nam. However, in many sites in which the species has  been detected (often as by-catch from camera-trap efforts focusing on  tigers) there are insufficient detections to estimate density suggesting  densities may be lower than those reported in the literature. The  range-wide models of MacDonald <em>et al.</em>(2019) estimated approximately 558,000 km<sup>2</sup> of high-quality Mainland Clouded Leopard habitat across the species’ range (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2019) which was revised to ~370,000 km² using more recent forest cover data (Petersen <em>et al.</em>2020a). An average density between ~1.8 and 2.7 individuals per 100 km²  across all high-quality habitat (dependent on the year of forest cover  estimation) would be required for a global population of &gt;10,000  mature individuals. Given likely absence due to hunting (See Geographic  Range / Population / Threats) in some of these areas, and the low  camera-trap detection rates in many other places, this range-wide  density estimate seems too high. As such this assessment believes that  the likely Mainland Clouded Leopard population is &lt;10,000 mature  individuals. However, estimated, as opposed to inferred, rates of  population decline are required to trigger Vulnerable under criterion C1.  Long-term monitoring of Mainland Clouded Leopard abundance within sites  are recommended in order to more accurately observe or estimate rates  of population change and this, potentially, trigger criterion C1 in  future assessments.<p></p>","The Mainland Clouded Leopard is intermediate in size between large and  small cats, with wild females from Thailand weighing 11.5 (Austin and  Tewes 1999) to 13.5 kg (Grassman <em>et al.</em> 2005), and males 16 (Grassman <em>et al.</em>  2005) to 18 kg (Austin and Tewes 1999). Its coat is patterned with  distinctive large cloud shaped markings, its canines are exceptionally  elongated, as is its tail - for a large cat (Sunquist and Sunquist  2002). The Mainland Clouded Leopard is highly arboreal and strongly  associated with forest habitat, particularly primary evergreen tropical  rainforest, but there are also records from dry and deciduous forest, as  well as secondary and logged forests. They have been recorded in the  Himalayas at elevations above 3,500 m (Can <em>et al.</em> 2020, Y. Ghimrey in litt., 2020).<br/><br/>Less  frequently, they have been found in grassland and scrub, dry tropical  forests and mangrove swamps (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Radio-tracking  studies in Thailand have shown a preference for forest over more open  habitats (Austin <em>et al.</em> 2007, Grassman <em>et al.</em> 2005). There  is some evidence from Peninsular Malaysia for the ability of animals to  persist amidst an agricultural matrix of certain land uses, including  rubber (Mukri <em>et al.</em> unpub.; A. Giordinao in litt., 2020).<br/><br/>A  study in Thailand's Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary found that Mainland  Clouded Leopards preyed upon a variety of arboreal and terrestrial prey,  including hog deer, slow loris, brush-tailed porcupine, Malayan  pangolin and Indochinese ground squirrel (Grassman <em>et al.</em> 2005).  Other observations include mainly primate prey, but also muntjac and  Argus pheasant (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Mainland Clouded Leopards are  primarily nocturnal, with crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Austin <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Two  radio-telemetry studies in different parks in Thailand found that adult  male and female Mainland Clouded Leopards had similar home range sizes  between 30-40 km² (95% fixed kernel estimators), with smaller  intensively used core areas of 3-5 km² (Grassman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Austin <em>et al.</em>  2007). While both studies found substantial home range overlap between  males and females, as is typical of most felids, Grassman <em>et al.</em>  (2005) also found that the ranges of their two radio-collared males  overlapped by a significant amount (39%). Although both studies found  similar home ranges, Mainland Clouded Leopards in Phu Khieo Wildlife  Sanctuary travelled approximately twice the average daily distance  (average 2 km) than Mainland Clouded Leopards in Khao Yai National Park  (Grassman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Austin <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Mainland  Clouded Leopards may occur at higher densities when densities of the  larger cats, tigers and leopards, are lower (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2001, Grassman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2020b).<p></p>","Mainland Clouded Leopards prefer closed forest (Grassman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Austin <em>et al.</em>  2007), and their habitat in Southeast Asia is undergoing amongst the  world's fastest deforestation rates (0.6% per year between 1990 and  2010; Stibig <em>et al.</em> 2014). A recent modelling paper estimated a  range-wide decline in the area of habitat categorised as strongholds for  Mainland Clouded Leopard (defined as large contiguous areas of  high-quality habitat where the species could survive over the  mid-to-long term) of 34% between 2000 and 2018 (Petersen <em>et al.</em>  2020a). In addition to direct habitat loss the degradation of habitat  and loss of functional connectivity is likely impacting many Mainland  Clouded Leopard populations and, with future infrastructure development,  particularly in Myanmar, this is likely to become a significant issue  (Kaszta <em>et al.</em> 2020). A boom in large number of hydropower  projects and rural roads in Mainland Clouded Leopard habitat is also a  potentially significant threat in Nepal (Ghimirey and Acharya 2018).<br/><br/>Nevertheless,  the biggest drive of population decline in Mainland Clouded Leopard  during the assessment period was likely mortality due to illegal hunting  – both targeted hunting for trade and incidental capture in  indiscriminate hunting snares. The low number of detections or absence  of the species from areas of suitable habitat particularly within  Myanmar and Indochina indicates the scale of this threat. For example,  in Cambodia the most recent records of the species from two apparently  suitable sites (Western Seam Pang and Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuaries)  were of individuals captured in ungulate hunting snares. The rapid  spread of snaring across Lao PDR and Cambodia, during the assessment  period (and in Viet Nam largely prior to the current assessment) is  likely the biggest cause of population decline during this period.<br/><br/>The  Mainland Clouded Leopard is also hunted for the illegal wildlife trade.  Large numbers of skins have been seen in market surveys, and there is  also trade in bones for medicines to supplement the tiger bone trade,  meat for exotic dishes and live animals for the pet trade (Hunter 2011).  Wild animals are likely to be the primary source, but there is also  some illegal trade from captive animals (Nowell 2007). For more details  of trade driven threats see Use and Trade above.<br/><br/>Additional  possible threats to Mainland Clouded Leopard which may require further  research and analysis include prey depletion. This is potentially a  threat in Indochina and China but seems likely to be a less significant  issue elsewhere in the range. Can <em>et al.</em> (2020) also highlighted  the potential impact of climate change on Mainland Clouded Leopard  particularly on higher elevation populations in central Nepal.<p></p>","The continued expansion of camera-trapping (including a number of  studies targeted on Mainland Clouded Leopard) across the species’ range  means that we have a better understanding of Mainland Clouded Leopard  population and densities than in the previous assessment in 2016. At  least six studies have published density estimates for Mainland Clouded  Leopards with estimates varying between 0.3 individuals per 100 km² (across large areas of Southern Bhutan: Penjor <em>et al.</em>2018) to 5.14 individuals per 100 km²  Dampa Tiger Reserve, India (Singh and MacDonald 2017). However, in the  majority of locations across the species’ range there are too few  camera-trap detections to estimate density and in other, apparently  suitable sites (see Geographic Range) there have been no recent records.  Camera-trap detection rates and naïve /modelled camera-trap occupancy  vary extensively across the species’ range. This variation is likely  linked to both sampling design and ecological conditions (e.g.  lower intrinsic carrying capacity for Mainland Clouded Leopard in high  elevation areas in the northern and western extremes of the range; Can <em>et al.</em> 2020) and anthropogenic pressures particularly poaching. In their range-wide camera-trap analysis MacDonald <em>et al.</em> (2019) reported naïve occupancy (from the 39 of 45 studies which detected the species) of between 0.02 and 0.44.<br/><br/>In  Peninsular Malaysia, documented declines in tiger abundance during the  assessment period (WWF Tigers Alive Initiative, in litt. 2020) and  evidence of targeted poaching of large cats, particularly using cable  snares, suggests Mainland Clouded Leopard populations will have declined  in the past 21 years. On at least two recent occasions (in 2017 and  2018) organized Vietnamese poaching gangs in Malaysia have been  apprehended with body parts of at least two Mainland Clouded Leopards,  as well as tiger, bear and wild boar body parts (TRAFFIC 2019).  Forested landscapes supporting Mainland Clouded Leopard in Malaysia  receive less targeted protection than in some other range countries  (e.g. Thailand, Nepal, India) and all occupied habitat is under, at  least some, poaching pressure. In Manas Tiger Reserve in India the  encounter rate of Mainland Clouded Leopard from camera-trapping has  declined in recent years (J. Borah, in litt. 2020) though the extent to  which this is due to behavioural changes following tiger recovery is  unclear. In Thailand there are recent records from at least 14 protected  areas in seven forest complexes (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2020a) but evidence that densities are lower in more accessible and heavily hunted areas (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2020b).<br/><br/>Camera-trap density estimates of Mainland Clouded Leopard exclude cubs (e.g. Petersen <em>et al.</em>2020b)  thus we assume that published density estimates refer to mature  individuals. Extrapolating published densities across the 558,000 km² of ‘good quality’ Mainland Clouded Leopard habitat modelled by MacDonald <em>et al.</em>  (2019) would give a global population of between 1,600 and 29,000 adult  individuals. Though a number of the areas identified as high-quality  habitat in this paper (e.g. in parts of Viet Nam and Lao PDR) are  unlikely to support the species due to hunting and habitat loss  (Petersen <em>et al.</em>2020a). Nevertheless, the global Mainland Clouded  Leopard population is probably incorporated within these bounds (e.g.  1,600–29,000) but is likely much more towards the lower end (see also  Assessment Rationale) with range-wide average densities of ~1.0  individual per 100 km² more realistic. This would give a population of between ~5,580 (based on MacDonald <em>et al.</em> 2019 available habitat) and ~3,700 (based on Petersen <em>et al.</em>  2020a available habitat) mature individuals. Given continued habitat  loss, fragmentation, and hunting across the range the population is  inferred to be continuing to decline. Long-term monitoring of Mainland  Clouded Leopard abundance within sites are recommended in order to more  accurately observe or estimate rates of population change and this,  potentially, trigger criterion C1 (i.e. &lt;10,000 mature individuals and  observed, estimated, or projected decline of &gt;10% in three  generations) in future assessments.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Mainland Clouded Leopard is found from the Himalayan foothills in  Nepal through Mainland Southeast Asia into China (Nowell and Jackson  1996). Mainland Clouded Leopard is extinct on the island of Taiwan  (Chiang <em>et al.</em> 2015) and numbers are very low, and the species may be close to extirpation, in Viet Nam (Wilcox <em>et al.</em> 2014), China, and Bangladesh.<br/><br/><strong>Bhutan<br/></strong>With a forest cover of 60%, the vast majority of the available habitat  in Bhutan is suitable for the Mainland Clouded Leopard. However, due to  the rapid increase in latitudinal elevation, Mainland Clouded Leopards  have a much higher probability of occurring in the southern forested  areas both inside and outside of protected areas than the northern  forested areas (Penjor <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using an occupancy sampling  framework, Mainland Clouded Leopard data gathered from the national  tiger survey showed that the species was predicted to occur across the  majority of the National Parks and connecting wildlife corridors  including the Wangchuck Centennial National Park, Sakteng Wildlife  Sanctuary, Jigme Dorji National Park, Bundling Wildlife Sanctuary, but  with the highest probability in the southern protected areas of Royal  Manas National Park (Tempa <em>et al.</em> 2013), Phipsoo Wildlife  Sanctuary, Phrumsengla National Park, Jomotshankha Wildlife Sanctuary,  Jigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve, and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National  Park (Lungten <em>et al.</em> unpub. data). <br/><br/><strong>Nepal<br/></strong>Mainland  Clouded Leopard were believed to be extinct in Nepal until 1987, when  two cubs were captured alive by local communities in southeast Nepal  (Dinerstein and Metha 1989) with the first camera-trap record, from  Shivapuri Nagarjuna National Park in 2010 (Ghimirey and Acharya 2016).  The expansion of camera-trapping studies across the country has  subsequently demonstrated that Mainland Clouded Leopard occurs  relatively extensively in eastern Nepal from the Terai in the south  (e.g. Chitwan and Parsa National Park) up to the Nepal-Tibet (China)  border in the north (e.g. Langtang NP) and as far west as Annapurna  Conservation Area. Confirmed records for the species have been made from  the protected areas of Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, Manaslu  Conservation Area, Annapurna Conservation Area, Langtang National Park,  Shivapuri Nagarjuna National Park, Chitwan National Park and Parsa  National Park and from the districts of Khotang. Records west of  Annapurna (e.g. Kailali district Ghodaghodi Lake, Api-Nampa Conservation  Area) have been questioned. Annapurna remains the westerly extent of  the species’ known global distribution (Ghimrey and Acharya 2016).  However, recent seizure of a pelt that supposedly originated in Pyuthan  district provides a possibility of pushing the westernmost limit further  west by around 100 km (Ghimirey and Acharya 2018). In addition, an  interview with a Nepalese park ranger produced a credible firsthand  observation of a Mainland Clouded Leopard in Khaptad National Park (A.  Bashyal and A. J. Giordano unpub. data). In Langtang National Park  Mainland Clouded Leopards have been detected from altitudes as high as  3,498 m (Can <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/><strong>India<br/></strong>Mainland Clouded Leopard occurs widely in northeastern India as far west as Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar (Shafi <em>et al.</em> 2019) with recent records from protected areas in at least Sikkim (Bashir <em>et al.</em> 2011), West Bengal (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2020), Assam (Borah <em>et al.</em> 2014), Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2019). Mukherjee <em>et al.</em>  (2019) reported on camera-trap studies from 10 sites across five  northeast Indian states with Mainland Clouded Leopard present from six  sites. The extensive camera-trapping and surveys for the 2018 All India  Tiger Census recorded Mainland Clouded Leopard from Kaziranga, Nameri  and Manas Tiger Reserves, Assam; Pakke, Kamlang and Namdapha Tiger  Reserves, Arunachal Pradesh, Buxa Tiger Reserve, West Bengal, and Dampa  Tiger Reserve, Mizoram (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2020). Published Mainland Clouded Leopard density estimates from Manas National Park (Borah <em>et al.</em>2014) and Dampa Tiger Reserve (Singh and MacDonald 2017) of 4.7 and 5.1 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup> are amongst the highest recorded across the species’ range.<br/><br/><strong>Bangladesh<br/></strong>Mainland Clouded Leopard likely persists in very small numbers in  suitable mountainous habitat in part of the Chittagong Hill Tracts of  southeast Bangladesh with at least one camera-trap photograph from  Sangu-Matamuhuri Reserve Forest collected by parabiologists between 2011  and 2015 (Creative Conservation Alliance 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Myanmar<br/></strong>The  vast majority of Myanmar is ecologically suitable for, and within the  historic range of, Mainland Clouded Leopard. However, as a result of  hunting and habitat loss, the species is now likely very thinly but  widely distributed across the dense evergreen forests particularly of  northern (e.g. Kachin / Sagain) and southern Myanmar (e.g. Kayin,  Taninthayi; Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2014, Greenspan <em>et al.</em> 2020). Zaw <em>et al.</em>  (2019) reported widespread occurrence in Kachin (Hukaung Valley  Wildlife Sanctuary, Hkakaborazi National Park Imaw Bum, Bumphar Bum  Area, Hphonkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, Myit Sone Area) and Sagaing  States (Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary, Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park  Proposed Mahamying Wildlife Sanctuary, Mt. Saramati Area) in the north  of the country with an apparently more reduced distribution in Rakhine  (Rakhine Yoma), Bago (Bago Yoma) and Shan States (Paunglaung Area).  Recent camera-trapping coordinated by the Kawthoolei Forestry Department  (KFD) has recorded Mainland Clouded Leopard from a number of protected  areas in Kayin State, including Kweekoh Wildlife Sanctuary, Kadoh Mae  Nyaw Wildlife Sanctuary, Yoe Mu Kyo (proposed Wildlife Sanctuary),  Megatha Wildlife Sanctuary, Maw Kee (proposed Wildlife Sanctuary), and  various unprotected forested areas, including the newly formed Salween  Peace Park (Moo <em>et al.</em> 2018; KFD unpub. data). However, the  species has not been detected in some apparently suitable areas, such as  Tu Ter Lor Wildlife Sanctuary and Klermu Thoepli Wildlife Sanctuary,  and the number of individuals detected in any area was low (Moo <em>et al.</em> 2018, KFD unpublished data) with a patchy distribution throughout the region (Greenspan <em>et al.</em>  2020). Mainland Clouded Leopard appears widespread in Tanintharyi with  recent records from most camera-trapping studies across the landscape,  such as Tanintharyi Nature Reserve, Kaser Doh Conservation Landscape,  Ler Mu Lah, and Lenya Reserve Forests (KFD unpub. data).<br/><br/>Lao PDR:  Mainland Clouded Leopard were historically distributed throughout Lao  PDR but the species has experienced significant declines prior to, and  during, the assessment period driven by intensive hunting, most notably  snaring. The most significant Mainland Clouded Leopard population  remains in Nam Et Phou Louey NPA where the species is the most widely  distributed large carnivore, although a decrease in density was detected  between 2013 and 2017, suggesting its future in the park is not secured  unless snaring is reduced (Rasphone 2018). In the rest of Lao PDR,  Mainland Clouded Leopard has become extremely rare and is likely  extirpated from many apparently suitable areas of forested habitat. For  example, extensive camera-trap surveys within Nakai Nam Theun National  Park since 2018 has not detected the species (which had been present in  low numbers between 2007-2011, Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2014; Coudrat, in  litt. 2020). Mainland Clouded Leopard remains present in some Karst  limestone protected areas, such as Phou Hin Poun NPA, where there has  been less pressure from hunting (Brakels and Somdachit, 2020). West of  the Mekong there are a couple of recent camera-trap records from Nam  Poui NPA (2016/17; F. Guegan, in litt. 2020). There are no recent  records from southern Lao PDR (e.g. Xe Sap NPA or Xe Pian NPA) and if  Mainland Clouded Leopard persist in southern Lao PDR they likely do so  in extremely low numbers.<br/><br/><strong>China<br/></strong>The Mainland Clouded Leopard  historically had a wide distribution in China, south of the Yangtze, but  recent records are few, habitat is fast disappearing, illegal hunting  of this species has been prolific and its current distribution in China  is poorly known and appears largely restricted to areas in Yunan  Province along the border with Lao PDR and Myanmar (Wozencraft <em>et al.</em>  2008, B.P.L. Chan, in litt. 2020). In a review of recent felid  camera-trapping across 28 protected areas and 10 provinces / autonomous  regions across China (939 camera-trap stations and 283,239 trap-nights)  between 2007 and 2019 Mainland Clouded Leopard were detected in three  sites: Medog County, Tibet Autonomous Region and two of four protected  areas (Yiwu and Tongbiguan) in Yunnan Province (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2020). In a review of recent range-wide records Petersen <em>et al.</em>  (2020a) found published records of Mainland Clouded Leopard from only  one (Medog County) of 25 camera-trapping studies in the species’  predicted range. More recent camera-trapping from the Chinese Felid  Conservation Alliance appear to have detected Mainland Clouded Leopard  from a number of additional sites in Yunnan province, thus a more  thorough assessment of the status of the species in China is required  (A. Giordano in litt. 2020). <br/><br/><strong>Thailand<br/></strong>Mainland Clouded Leopards  appear to be widely distributed throughout Thailand’s highly fragmented  forests based on the results of a recent literature review (Petersen <em>et al.</em>  2020a). As is common elsewhere across the species range, most records  in Thailand are derived from tiger survey bycatch data; therefore,  generalizations about possible occurrence in unsurveyed areas should be  made cautiously. Recent published camera-trap records (2010 onwards)  confirm the presence of at least one individual in most major forest  complexes (i.e., WEFCOM, Kaeng Krachan FC, Khlong Saeng-Khao Sok FC,  Hala Bala FC, Eastern FC, Dong-Phayayen-Khao Yai FC, and Phu Khieo-Nam  Nao FC). The species status in less frequently surveyed areas, however,  is uncertain. Specifically, there are a lack of recent published records  from the relatively unexplored forest complexes in northern (i.e., Lum  Nam Pai-Salawin FC, Sri Lanna-Khun Tan FC, Doi Phu Kha-Mae Yom FC, Mae  Ping-Om Koi FC, and Phu Meang-Phu Thong FC), northeastern (i.e., Phu  Parn FC and Phanom Dongkrak-Pha Tam), and southern Thailand (i.e., Khao  Luang FC and Khao Bantad FC).<br/><br/><strong>Cambodia<br/></strong>Mainland Clouded Leopard  historically occurred throughout Cambodia’s evergreen and semi-evergreen  forests and was likely only absent from the lowlands surrounding the  Tonle Sap. However, the species has declined significantly in both  distribution and abundance in the past 20 years with post 2014 records  from only Siem Pang Wildlife Sanctuary and Virachey National Park in the  northeast, and the Cardamom Rainforest Landscape in the southwest. The  latter two sites (Virachey and the Cardamoms) represent the largest and  most inaccessible evergreen forest landscapes in the country. Mainland  Clouded Leopard have been recently (post-2018) recorded from  camera-traps in multiple locations in Virachey National Park (McCann <em>et al.</em>  2020) and at least four protected areas in the Cardamom Rainforest  Landscape (Botum Sakor National Park, Central Cardamom National Park,  Southern Cardamom National Park, and Tatai Wildlife Sanctuary (Gray <em>et al.</em>  2017). These two landscapes represent the last strongholds for Mainland  Clouded Leopard in Cambodia, although in all sites the number of  camera-trap records were insufficient to estimate density. Elsewhere in  Cambodia Mainland Clouded Leopard have become extremely scarce and may  be extirpated. In the Siem Pang Wildlife Sanctuary complex, Stung Treng  Province, a single Mainland Clouded Leopard was photographed by  camera-traps in April 2016 and a pregnant female was captured alive in a  snare in February 2020 (J. C. Eames in litt. 2020). In the Eastern  Plains Landscape, Mondulkiri Province, Mainland Clouded Leopard was last  camera-trapped in December 2012 (from Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary),  with no documented records from the more extensive evergreen forests of  Seima Wildlife Sanctuary since 2006 (when an individual was released  alive from a snare) whereas the last camera-trap record was obtained  from March 2003 (WWF-Cambodia, in litt. 2020). In the Northern Plains  Landscape of Preah Vihear, the species was last detected on camera-traps  from Chepp Wildlife Sanctuary in 2014 however one Mainland Clouded  Leopard was camera-trapped from Phnom Dongrak, on the border with  Thailand, in November 2020 (L. Grassman, in litt., 2020). There are no  recent records from Prey Long Wildlife Sanctuary (WCS-Cambodia, in litt.  2020). In the adjacent Phnom Tnaout Wildlife Sanctuary apparent  Mainland Clouded Leopard tracks were recorded in 2014 but have not been  found subsequently (S. Davis, in litt. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Viet Nam<br/></strong>Mainland  Clouded Leopard was historically widespread throughout the evergreen  forests of Viet Nam however there are no recent records and the species  is likely close to extinction from the country due to industrial levels  of snaring and other hunting. The last documented record of Mainland  Clouded Leopard from Viet Nam was from Pu Luong (a protected area  dominated by karst limestone forests and thus protected, to some extent,  from snaring) in December 2003. In their country-wide review of the  status of wild cats, Wilcox <em>et al.</em> (2014) documented only two  other (earlier) confirmed records of Mainland Clouded Leopard across the  country between 1995 and 2013. Whilst there is possibility of dispersal  into remote areas of Viet Nam from Lao PDR (A. Giordano in litt., 2020)  camera-trap studies since 2013 across the country from at least 19  protected areas, including Pu Luong, have not detected the species.<br/><br/><strong>Malaysia</strong>Mainland Clouded Leopards are still relatively widespread across  Peninsular Malaysia (Perhiltan 2017), and can be found all the way from  the north of the country bordering Thailand, to the most southern state  of Johor. They predominantly occur within the Central Forest Spine map  (DTCP 2009), a ~51,000 km² landscape which forms the majority  of Peninsular Malaysia’s remaining forests, which includes large  protected-area complexes (e.g., Belum-Temengor, Taman Negara, Endau  Rompin), as well as Forest Reserves (e.g., Pasoh FR, Ulu Muda FR, Pasir  Raja Selatan FR, Tanum FR, Sungai Yun FR), and Linkage areas (Primary  Linkage 7, Primary Linkage 8, Tan <em>et al.</em> 2017, Rostro-García <em>et al.</em>  unpub. data). Much of it is contiguous, and the areas outside it are  relatively small and fragmented – even if they still harbor Mainland  Clouded Leopards they might not persist over the long-term.<p></p>","<p>Mainland Clouded Leopard exploitation for pelts is well documented in  several countries, and the species’ parts remain noted in trade. Whilst  some market surveys are recording fewer Mainland Clouded Leopard items  since ~2010 this may represent trade moving underground and becoming  more difficult to detect particularly in notorious borders markets in  Myanmar. Population declines and local extinctions may also be  contributing to declines in the number of Mainland Clouded Leopard  occurring in trade. Recent (2016/17) surveys in Mong La, Special Region  4, Shan State, Myanmar found 11 Mainland Clouded Leopard skulls and 4  full skins (Sapai Min, in litt. 2020) compared to 54 skulls in December  2013 and 17 skulls and 5 full skins in February 2009 (Nijman and  Shepherd 2015). In contrast, at Tachilik, Shan State on the  Myanmar-Thailand border 2016/17 surveys found 8 full skins and 17  Mainland Clouded Leopard skulls (Sapai Min, in litt. 2020) compared to  22 skulls and 4 full skins in February 2006 (Nijman and Shepherd 2015).  Mainland Clouded Leopard trade is also reported in other range states  with a seizure of 19 Mainland Clouded Leopard skins in Phnom Penh,  Cambodia in October 2014 (S. Gauntlett, in litt. 2020). A recent study  in Nepal found a total of at least 51 individual Mainland Clouded  Leopards in trade in just over 30 years (Ghimirey and Acharya 2018)  whilst in Northeast India six cases of Mainland Clouded Leopard seizures  were reported between 2015 and 2020; five were of skin and one of teeth  and bones (J. Borah, in litt. 2020) and three cases of illegal poaching  of Mainland Clouded Leopard were recorded from Bhutan in 2013/14 (W. M.  Wong, in litt. 2020). These seizures and surveys likely represent a  small proportion of the trade in Mainland Clouded Leopard parts in Asia,  and highlight that wild off-take (either targeted poaching or through  capture in indiscriminate hunting methods such as snares) is likely  causing declines in many populations.<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I and protected by national legislation over  most of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, in all countries,  particularly in Southeast Asia, the interpretation of the law protecting  Mainland Clouded Leopard is imperfect and can be undermined by  corruption. Fines and punishments also need to be increased. <br/><br/>Despite  co-occurring with tiger in many protected areas, and the growth of  camera-trapping studies, there are no published temporal trends in  Mainland Clouded Leopard population size or density. This remains a  research priority and such information would strengthen future  assessments and implementation of conservation activities.<br/><br/>The  species occurs in many protected areas, although direct exploitation,  range fragmentation, and reduction in habitat quality have caused  Mainland Clouded Leopard declines within protected areas across its  range. Improving the effectiveness of Protected Area management through  implementing the Zero Poaching tool-kit (<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://zeropoaching.org/"">http://zeropoaching.org/</a>) and achieving Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CA|TS; Pasha <em>et al.</em> 2018) is likely to significantly reduce threats impacting Mainland Clouded Leopard populations within protected areas.<br/><br/>Given  that much Mainland Clouded Leopard occurs in transboundary conservation  landscapes the species should be considered in transboundary  conservation planning (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2019).<p></p>",Indomalayan,,False,False,Global

This species is therefore listed as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","This species inhabits open, arid and sparsely vegetated steppe and semi-desert (Launay <em>et al.</em> 1997, Osborne <em>et al.</em> 1997, Mian 2003, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003). It favours scattered shrubby vegetation, typically comprising xerophytic or halophytic plants (Collar 1996). Those wintering in Iran have been shown to prefer more densely vegetated bush-steppe to sparser shrub-steppe; however, within those bush-steppe habitats they favour areas with reduced vegetation cover (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Bush-steppe is thought to contain a higher abundance of food sources such as<em> Salsola</em> spp. and arthropods (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). Birds wintering in Iran also routinely visit neighbouring farmland where alfalfa and salad rocket is grown, but avoid pistachio crops (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although dense vegetation may provide a sanctuary from danger, as well as thermal protection when overnight temperatures drop in winter (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al.</em> 2010), more open, unvegetated areas are often favoured as night-time roosts in order to minimise the risk of ambush by nocturnal predators (Combreau and Smith 1997). On the breeding grounds, nesting females may also favour sites away from vegetation patches, which could provide cover for predators (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2012). Abundance of breeding males has been found to be higher in flat areas with shorter shrub vegetation which is likely to be more suitable for displaying (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<br/><p>The species feeds throughout the day, but is most active at dawn and dusk (Combreau and Launay 1996). It has an eclectic diet, mainly comprising plants and invertebrates (especially ants Formicidae and beetles Tenebrionidae: Tigar and Osborne 2000), but also including vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, small snakes and even young birds (Collar 1996, Tourenq <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/></p><p>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996). Males play no part in rearing the young, and a brood may contain young sired by several different individuals (Lesobre <em>et al</em>. 2010). Females create a shallow scrape in the ground in which they typically lay 3-4 eggs, and occasionally up to six eggs in long-distance migrants (Collar 1996, Combreau <em>et al</em>. 2002). The incubation period is typically 24 days, whilst fledging takes around 35 days.<br/></p><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting (primarily using falconry), largely but not exclusively on the species's wintering grounds (Judas <em>et al. </em>2009). Large numbers are also trapped, mainly in Pakistan and Iran, and shipped to Arabia for use in the training of falcons (Combreau 2007); hunting and trapping are responsible for more than 50% of mortality in Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;In 2014 an illegal shipment of 240 birds was intercepted en route from Pakistan to Bahrain (Shafaeipour <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Arab countries, the meat of this species is considered an aphrodisiac, attracting hunters of high status (Nabi <em>et al., </em>2019); in 2017-2019, permits for hunting of the Asian Houbara were given by Pakistan to royal Arabs, and unregulated hunting seems to be continuing. Eggs are also collected during the breeding season (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021). In recent years the species has been heavily hunted in Iraq, as the country has opened up to visits by hunters from other countries (R. Porter&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>In parts of the region, fast-paced development related to the growth of the petroleum industry has reduced the availability of undisturbed habitats and further exacerbated the species's decline. Oil exploration, road building, oil and water pipelines, mining and quarrying activities, powerlines and the general disturbance caused by four-wheel drive vehicles have all been identified as significant auxiliary threats.  Powerlines in particular may be a significant threat (M. Koshkin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Preliminary data from Uzbekistan suggests that powerlines may contribute to species mortality (Burnside <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Livestock grazing is reported to have a negative impact on the species, both indirectly, by degrading the desert vegetation on which birds rely for food and concealment, and directly, through the trampling of nests and disturbance of nesting females (Lavee 1988). Recent research on the effects of pastoralism on this species in the Kyzylkum Desert in Uzbekistan, however, has found that low intensity livestock grazing may not widely degrade rangelands at a landscape scale (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has no effect on male abundance and female nesting success (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b). In Iran, loss of habitat to croplands, mainly through the planting of pistachio, has been judged to be a significant threat (Mansoori 2006); however, it has also been found that the species exploits other crops such as alfalfa and salad rocket (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Yousefi (2017) reported a high degree of dependence on habitats in the vicinity of croplands, with habitats more than 6 km away losing their suitability. In Saudi Arabia, eggs and nests are predated by a range of mammalian predators (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p>Habitat modelling and climate projections predict an increase in suitable habitat in the future, including shifts in geographic distribution of suitable habitat (Yousefi <em>et al., </em>2017); however, the probability of chick survival may decrease in areas with relatively higher temperatures (Koshkin <em>et al., </em>2016), and higher mortality has been reported from Iran in harsh wintering conditions (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).<br/><br/>The primary conservation approach for this species has been captive-breeding and release, however this may be unsustainable and detrimental to wild populations. Over reliance on supplementation of wild populations with captive-bred individuals risks domestication and replacement, rather than conservation reinforcement, with the potential of release of less-fit individuals causing a long-term reduction in the size, genetic diversity and viability of wild populations (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018). With the current extent of unregulated harvest, one model reports that wild populations would require releasing over 3000 captive-bred females a year, more than the initial wild stock, to attain population stabilisation (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018).&#160;Releasing captive-bred stock may also create the allusion that mitigation measures are successful, which can lead to increased hunting pressure.","The population was last estimated to be between 78,960 and 97,000 individuals globally (O. Combreau&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014, BirdLife International 2014), and stated as poorly known in 2016 (BirdLife International). Studies since have primarily focused on nest site selection and reintroduced populations; available data on breeding parameters of wild populations are insufficient (Azar&#160;<em>et al.,&#160;</em>2018). Accurately establishing the global population is extremely challenging. The population is expected to fall within the population band for 50,000-99,999 individuals, which is assumed to equate to c.33,000-67,000 mature individuals. The breeding population in Kazakhstan has been estimated at c.49,000 individuals (Riou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;extends from <strong>Egypt</strong> east of the Nile, through <strong>Israel</strong>, <strong>Palestine</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Yemen</strong>, <strong>Oman</strong>, <strong>U.A.E.</strong>, <strong>Bahrain</strong>, <strong>Qatar</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Kuwait</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> and <strong>Mongolia</strong> to<strong> China</strong>.

The species is considered Critically Endangered on the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015). Studies have been conducted into the status, ecology and migration of the species in various parts of its range, most notably Kazakhstan (Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002, Tourenq <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt</em><em>.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004, Riou <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Uzbekistan (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016a,b). Through its network of breeding facilities in the U.A.E., Morocco and Kazakhstan, the International Fund for Houbara Conservation (IFHC) has a long-term goal to produce 35,000 Asian Houbaras each year for reintroduction into the wild (IFHC 2014). The first releases were made in Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in central Saudi Arabia in 1991. This population is currently estimated to number 250–300 individuals. Further releases have taken place elsewhere in Saudi  Arabia (including at Saja Umm ar Rimth with c.50 individuals [M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016]) and also in U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Yemen, Jordan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. By the end of 2016, 13,504 houbara had been released into the UAE (Azar <em>et al., </em>2018). It is not yet clear what impact the releases of captive-reared birds have on the demographics and genetic integrity of the overall population,&#160;however according to Burnside <em>et al.</em> (2016), in order to compensate for the loss of wild adults to hunting, the number of released birds may need to be as much as 10 times higher than hunting quotas. At least three birds have been satellite tracked from Saudi Arabia to the breeding grounds in Kazakhstan (Zafar-ul Islam <em>et al</em>. 2014). The CMS Asian Houbara Agreement (2005) urges all range countries to take necessary measures to prevent the extinction of any population of Houbara and maintain a favourable status.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The most urgently needed conservation measures are those that will reduce exploitation to a biologically sustainable level. This will require precautionary and scientifically determined limits on the number of birds that can be harvested legally and stricter enforcement of bans on illegal forms of trade and hunting; it also requires in-depth studies of natural productivity in Asian Houbaras in relation to habitat selection and predator abundance. Carry out further surveys to gain an improved estimate of the overall population size and trend; continue research to determine the migration routes, schedules and strategies of all populations. Survey the species throughout the wintering range (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Produce a range-wide action and recovery plan, based on agreement under the Convention on Migratory Species; the CMS Asian Houbara Agreement has been drafted but has not been opened for signature. Develop and implement national and regional species action plans (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Create managed protected areas and review current protected areas. For example, approximately 85% of suitable habitat are outside the existing protected area network of Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;Where they can be shown to be detrimental, reduce grazing and other farming pressures (Goriup 1997, Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004). Establish long-term, range-wide population monitoring studies. Study the overall demographic and genetic consequences of releasing captive-reared birds.

It is often seen in Dhars, sandy patches and associated areas with sparse vegetation and agriculture fields and human settlements (Baig <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Rajasthan Thar, the species is found to occupy slightly clayey and hard soil which may be gravelly and rocky or it may be found in saline depressions with sparse ground vegetation consisting of grasses and xerophytic shrubs (Das and Pandey 2005). They are mainly herbivorous but young also eat insects (Baig <em>et al</em>. 2008, Das <em>et al</em>. 2013). Its food includes grasses, flowers, fruits and other vegetable matter with some minute portions of insect parts (beetle, weevil, nematodes) (Das and Pandey 2005). Breeding season extends from June to September and the female lays 8–15 eggs near her&#160; burrow opening (Prakash 1977). Hawks, owls, Cattle Egret, jackals and foxes are its major predators (Mayura&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Tiwari&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Masroor 2011, Dookia <em>et al</em>. 2012). They have several nematode (Goldberg <em>et al</em>. 2003), trematode (Bhalerao 1931) and protozoan (Janakidevi 1961) endoparasites.","This species is widely killed and exploited for several purposes, particularly its use in traditional medicine (Khan 2006), but the effects of this activity on the species' population are unknown. The species is, however, very common in parts of Pakistan (T. Papenfuss pers. comm. 2016). Road kills have also been observed (Sunderraj <em>et al</em>. 2010, Solanki <em>et al</em>. 2015), and is considered a minor threat to this species. It is also likely to be impacted by general threats from habitat loss.","There is no information on the population status of this species in Afghanistan, as it is known from two specimens in a rarely-visited area. It appears to be very common in Pakistan (T. Papenfuss pers. comm. 2016). It is locally common in India. However, the Uttar Pradesh subpopulation is presumed to be locally extinct, and the Madhya Pradesh subpopulation is also declining at a fast rate (P. Mohapatra pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>                  There is no detailed information on the population structure and trends in Pakistan. It has been suggested that the species&#160;is common in Cholistan Desert (Baig <em>et al</em>. 2008), Banni Grasslands Reserve (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Chakwal (Rais e<em>t al</em>. 2012) but rare in Rawalpindi (Rais <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, replacement of semiarid grassland into agricultural land could lead to predicted declines up to 20% in Abdasa near Kachchh Gujarat (Dutta and Jhala 2014). Molur <em>et al</em>. (1998) have suggested 20% decline over a period of 10 years. A population reduction between 30–35% is suspected to have occurred in the last thirty years, which encompass three generations (generation length is not exactly known, but longevity is estimated to be between 10–12 years).",Decreasing,"This species is somewhat widespread in northwestern India, ranging from there along the Indus Valley in eastern Pakistan south as far as Las Bela (Khan 2006, Sindaco and Jeremčenko 2008). It occurs marginally in northeastern Afghanistan, at least in the area near Jalalabad (Wilms <em>et al</em>. 2009); two additional Afghan specimens have no associated locality data (Wagner <em>et al.</em> 2016). A report from Andhra Pradesh, India's northwestern-most state, is in error (Sindaco and Jeremčenko 2008).","This species is widely exploited for its oil, which is used in traditional medicine (Gupta<em> et al</em>. 2003). In India and Pakistan it is collected for use in school and university demonstrations of vertebrate anatomy, and in Punjab as bait to capture birds for use in falconry (Khan 2006). It is found in the international pet trade, but no detailed information is available (Khan 2006). It is consumed locally (Prakash 1977, Abdulali 1960, Das and Pande 2005).

This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or higher over the next three generations. Ongoing threats from increasing habitat loss due to development, new settlements, agriculture, plantation, and other activities, and from hunting for various reasons, the species is likely to face a higher threat of decline unless specific actions are taken to ensure its survival. Nationally, in India this species is listed as Endangered, and in Bangladesh it is Critically Endangered.</p>","This is a predominantly arboreal animal. It is diurnal and frugivorous. It occupies tropical evergreen and semi­-evergreen forest, tropical wet evergreen forest, tropical&#160; moist deciduous forest, coastal forest, swamp forest, low elevation pine forests (in Lao PDR and China) and montane forest, including degraded forests. In China the species occupies elevations between 50­2,000 m (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, Choudhury 2003). In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is associated with low lands, usually below 500 m. Its generation length is 12-­13 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). According to secondary information and recent records, populations in Myanmar live between 190­-400 m (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>Dark evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, tropical, subtropical and deciduous forests in plains, foothills, hills. (50-2,000 m). Found in lowland primary, secondary forest, pine, dry dipterocarp, coastal swamp, montane forest. Frequently observed in riparian forests in western Thailand and Laos, occasionally near human settlements, cultivated fields where it once relatively common (back in 1990), even in highly degraded regions. Known to share associations with Assamese macaques (<em>Macaca assamemensis</em>) western Thailand and the ranges of the two species were observed to overlap in Assam. Range overlaps also with Stump-tailed and Rhesus macaques besides langurs and Hoolocks (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>This species eats more than 91 kinds of plants such as mature and tender leaves, leaf buds, leaf petioles, seeds, stems, climbers, roots, flowers, flower buds, inflorescences, bamboo shoots, and gums, insects, larvae, termite eggs and spiders. They also feed on post-harvest Rice paddy in NE India and fruits and vegetables by slash and burn agriculture of the hill tribe. Habituated groups have also been observed to beg for food and feed on biscuits as in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand.<br/><br/>In NE India, winter-spring breeding has been observed. Females are sexually receptive in August-December, but some might continue through to February. Birthing occurs in mid-January, early May, and a few in June. Swellings occur during breeding, as in Lion-tailed Macaques (<em>Macaca silenus</em>). Gestation period is 171-180 days (Choudhury 2008).<br/><br/>This species is primarily arboreal, but it may use both terrestrial and arboreal pathways; individuals flee from danger through trees and not by ground. They use the ground when crossing clearings, roads, to forage, feed in degraded areas and also feed on crops. Seasonal fluctuations dictate the time spent on the ground feeding on crops. One site reported macaques spending over 20% of their time feeding on the ground on sugar cane left overs by elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). Detailed observation of the species in eastern and central Assam in 1992-1994 and 2004 recorded three peaks of feeding and long mid-day rest, shorter mid-morning rest spells, resting 45%, feeding 23.5%, locomotion 17-19.4%, grooming 6-8%. Actual time spent feeding 153-229 mins/day. Spent 65% of feeding time in January on harvested paddy.<br/><br/>In Assam (Tikleswari, Borajan) the macaques raids the vegetable gardens, crop field and villages (D. Chetry and D. Das pers. comm).<br/><br/>Home range is 83-347 ha, with about 25-48% overlap (Choudhury 2008). Daily movement is 690-2,240 m, influenced by weather and availability of fruits: where fruiting trees were far apart, the daily movement increased. Multi-male, multi-female groups of 12-40 individuals are seen (Choudhury 2008). Estimated group size in Laos rarely exceeds 20-30 individuals. There are few records of groups numbering 50-150 individuals in KhaoYai National Park in Thailand, DakLak Province in Viet Nam and DhouPhouVieng National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos. It may be the case that two or more groups were feeding together.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km2 as studied in 21 sites.&#160; They spent only about 1% of their time on the ground and about 85% of their time on mid canopy and in 97.6% of the cases found inside the forest as opposed to the sympatric <em>M. mulatta </em>that is found outside forests in farms and gardens. Direct competition was found to be scarce between the species and the overlap or sharing of resources was only found to be 22.4%. Of the 101 plant species used between both the species, only 42.6%&#160; shared (Feroz 2012).<br/><br/>In KhaoYai National Park,Thailand these macaques preferred tall sleeping trees (mean 20.9+/- SD 4.9 m) and ‘high sleeping places’(15.8+/- SD 4.3 m) and tend to reuse the sleeping site, an anti-predator strategy (Albert <em>et al</em>. 2011).","Habitat disturbances affecting the future survival of this species include: selective logging; timber and firewood collection for making charcoal; building roads, dams, power lines; and deliberately setting fires. These threats lead to&#160; forest fragmentation and soil loss/erosion. Specifically, a decrease in habitat quality has been due to the loss of fruiting trees and sleeping sites through monocultures and plantations, selective felling, and a subsequent increase in canopy gaps. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Habitat loss and poaching are the major threats in India and Bangladesh. There has been a reduction in forest in Assam by over 10% in two years between 2001 and 2003 (Forest Survey of India 2003) and the rate of habitat loss has not reduced. Recent forest cover survey report of Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Government of India suggest that the dense forest cover in the distribution range is decreasing 2011-2013.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting for food and trade is the primary threat, but as a predominantly lowland species habitat&#160; loss likely is also a major threat to the&#160; species. In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. Sometimes, a well-trained macaque is sold for 1,000 USD. They are also in demand by resorts for show (R. Boonratana pers. comm). <br/><br/>In Myanmar, hunting, trade, habitat loss in varying degrees, shifting cultivation in the north, logging in the east and south, and rubber plantations are the major threats (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>In China, hunting, habitat loss and disturbance are major threats. There is a perceptible change in habitat quality that has an impact on the species (Huang <em>et al</em>. pers. comm).","In China, the species’ population is estimated to be less than 1,700 individuals (Jiang and Long pers. comm). No information is available on the status of the population dynamics, but it is suspected to be in decline. A very small population occurs in Bangladesh, which is isolated from the neighbouring Indian locations. This habitat is degrading rapidly, thereby causing a continuing decline in mature individuals in the country (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>A group density of 0.07 individuals/km² was recorded in Namdapha National Park, India, by Chetry <em>et al</em>. (2003). There is no precise information available on population numbers in Myanmar. In India the population is &lt;1,500 individuals and populations are declining rapidly (Chetry and Das pers. comm.) but in one protected area (Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary) it is increasing. Choudhury (2003) stated that there may have been around 24,000 of these macaques in India at the turn of this century. The population has apparently declined owing to habitat loss.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km² as studied in 21 sites. The mean of seven groups in Assam was 23.3 (range: 16-33) (Choudhury 2008); however, the largest group observed was of 43 macaques in Radhakishorepur reserved forest, Tripura in 2016 (Choudhury in press).<br/><br/>It is also declining steadily in Myanmar.&#160; The animals are very patchily distributed in Myanmar. <br/><br/>The species is widely distributed and common in large forest blocks remaining in southern and central Lao PDR, but it is much scarcer in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam (R. Timmins pers. comm). It is widely distributed through the remaining forest areas of Cambodia. Populations are stable in Thailand. <br/><br/>Declines are due to different threats in different countries. There have been declines of more than 30% in the last 30­-35 (three generations) years in India, Bangladesh, China, Viet Nam and Myanmar. There are perceptible declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia, but the rates are close to or lower than 30%. In most of the countries, the species is predicted to decline at a rate higher than 30% over the next three generations due to increasing trends in habitat loss, persecution, and trade.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in eastern Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China (southwestern Yunnan), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura (Choudhury 1988, 2013)), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand (from about 8°N and including adjacent islands), and central and southern Viet Nam. There might be a gap in the distribution in central and northeastern Myanmar between about 20 and 25°N, where it has not been recorded except on the coast at Arakan. In India found north to the Brahmaputra River (Groves 2001).<br/><br/>Records from Xizang (China) are probably misidentified rhesus macaques (MacKinnon in press).  It has recently been recorded from Namdapha National Park in northeastern India (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>The precise taxonomic boundary between <em>M. leonina</em> and <em>M. nemestrina</em> is not well defined. There are populations of the two taxa found on either side of the distribution limits in the Isthmus of Kra, but many of these populations are the result of release by humans. The two species hybridize in a small area of southern peninsular Thailand, as well as on the islands of Phuket and Yao Yai (Groves 2001).  <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, there are historical records from as far north as Nghe An province, but there is uncertainty whether the species was ever found north of this province. It is widely distributed throughout the lower elevations (below 500 m) of Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is found over much Myanmar except in areas of human settlements.","In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. In almost throughout its range, the species is hunted for meat and for 'medicine'.

Poaching for traditional medicine is now a threat to all primates in the country and no new conservation program is in place.<br/><br/>Other direct threats include logging, gold mining, shifting cultivation by the hill tribe minority, development of economy and infrastructure resulting in habitat loss and degradation, hunting for food by villagers, hunting for traditional medicine to supply bone to the Viet Nam for use in medicine. Although in their incipient stage, agriculture, mining and hydropower are causing significant damages in terms of forest loss. In Cambodia, the species is reported only in five out of 24 provinces: use in traditional medicine, loss of habitat from logging, and trade are major threats in the region. In Myanmar, logging, plantation, aquaculture, hunting for food and pets, political unrest in cultural minority states impact primates. Timber extraction, large scale farms and plantations, irrigation, hydroelectric projects, highway construction, mineral exploration, resettlement programs for hill tribes, recreation and tourism, have significantly reduced forest cover in Thailand. Shifting cultivation of hill tribes and ethnic Thais have cleared large forests.

Occupied sites are characterised by a combination of low shrubs subject to regular browsing and cutting, with grass growing through spring and summer being widely harvested for livestock fodder in the autumn. It has been recorded in regenerating coniferous and broadleaved forests, as well as juniper and rhododendron on grassy slopes  (Subedi 2003). Its preference for early successional habitats, often created by traditional grass cutting and burning regimes, has led to an association with human settlements (and therefore high susceptibility to hunting). It digs for roots and tubers, and also eats seeds, berries, insects and grubs (Ali and Ripley 1987). It has been recorded breeding in India in May, June and September with clutch sizes of 6-12 eggs (Bisht <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p>","Having been widely shot for sport in the early 20th century, it is still hunted for food, and its eggs are collected for local consumption. Indeed, hunters in Nepal claim that they can trap up to 50 birds in one session through the use of snares and live decoys (Singh 2009), methods that are widespread in the species' range (P. Garson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2009). Hunting pressure in Nepal may be exacerbated by increased gun-ownership following the Maoist insurgency, especially in the west of the country (C. Inskipp <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2009). The species is hunted in remote  areas to provide a traditional treatment of asthma, body pain and fever, and it may be traded locally, although in some areas  local people strictly prohibit hunting (C. Inskipp and H.S. Baral <em>in litt. </em>2013).<br/>The patchy nature of its specialised habitat may render the smallest isolated populations vulnerable to extinctions, and higher levels of disturbance, grazing and the felling of wooded ravines now pose a substantial threat. In particular, hunting pressure and habitat destruction by fire and overgrazing have been implicated in its decline in Pakistan (Subedi 2003). However, burning, grazing and timber collection are also important in maintaining the open successiional habitats which the species favours, and healthy populations have persisted in some heavily grazed sites such as the Chail and Majathal Wildlife Sanctuaries in Himachal Pradesh (P. Garson <em>in litt. </em>2013). Notably, Singh <em>et al. </em>(2011) found no correlation between Cheer Pheasant density and either grass cover or measures of grazing pressure in Dhorpatan Valley, Nepal, suggesting that current levels of&#160; exploitation were not adversely affecting the species. However the conversion of grassland to permanent arable terraces is reducing available habitat, as are schemes to plant mid-altitude grasslands with forest. Nest disturbance by dogs has also been identified as a threat. <br/>Hydroelectric projects (HEPs) have been planned in almost all major rivers and their tributaries in Himachal Pradesh (S.P. Dhiman <em>in litt. </em>2013). A large area of Majathal Wildlife Sanctuary is under threat from submergence due to the construction of the Kol Dam upriver on the Sutlej River, and large-scale dam projects also threaten sites in the Beas Valley (V. Jolli <em>in litt. </em>2013). A total of 125 planned HEPs in the major river basins include 43 HEPs in the Sutlej catchment, 45 in the Beas, 26 in the Ravi and 11 in the Yamuna (S.P. Dhiman<em> in litt. </em>2013).<br/>Many populations in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand lie outside the protected area network and hence are vulnerable to illegal trapping and hunting (R. Kalsi <em>in litt. </em>2013). Furthermore, in June 2013 the boundaries of many protected areas were redefined to exclude villages, and some important habitats near human habitations (including Majathal, Chail and Kalatop Khajjiar) are now excluded from the protected area network, leaving them at greater risk of over-exploitation and development (S.P. Dhiman <em>in litt. </em>2013).  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p></p>","Quantifying this species' population size is difficult due to ongoing declines which are thought to have decreased numbers (sometimes considerably) since estimates were made. Previous suggestion that there are only 2000-2,700 mature individuals (Rahmani 2012) may have proven too pessimistic. Although the Nepalese population is estimated at fewer than 1,500 individuals (c. 1,000 mature individuals; C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012), Awan <em>et al</em>.

In Pakistan a re-introduction project in Margalla Hills National Park was unsuccessful. Capacity building workshops were organized for Wildlife staff of Jhelum valley in 2011 to improve long-term monitoring at established survey plots. Additionally conservation awareness sessions were delivered in schools and with communities of the Jhelum valley to help raise their awareness of the pheasant and its habitat (Awan 2011).

Clutch size is two to four eggs. Nest-hole excavation, incubation and chick-rearing are conducted by both sexes, with helpers at some nests. It forages in noisy groups of three to six individuals and sometimes more (Lammertink 2004)<strong></strong>. Groups occupy large territories. It is not a migrant, &#160;however, in areas of its distribution that show a marked seasonality (e.g. Himalayan foothills) the home range appears to expand locally during winters (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2011). <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> It occupies primary semi-open moist deciduous and tropical evergreen old growth, lower elevation forests, as well as adjacent secondary forest and clearings with scattered tall trees. It prefers dipterocarp (e.g. Shorea robusta in Himalayan foothills [R. Kumar <em>in litt. </em>2016])&#160;and teak forests in certain areas, as well as swamp-forest and tall mangroves.

The scale and cause of this varies in different countries, but almost nowhere in its range is totally removed from the overarching threat. In the Greater Sundas (especially lowland Borneo and Sumatra), the principal driver of forest cover loss has been the industrial-scale removal of forest, initially for timber extraction, but motivated in part or in whole by the replacement of these forested areas with large-scale plantations, especially oil-palm and rubber. More locally, this is compounded by localised shifting agriculture and timber extraction, the latter especially targeting larger, hollow-bearing trees needed by this species. The damage caused in Indochina has ostensibly been lesser, with rates of overall forest cover loss incomparable to those in the Greater Sundas (Global Forest Watch 2023); however, here selective logging and clearance for agriculture has been pervasive, rendering remaining stands of forest among the least intact in Asia (Grantham <em>et al</em>. 2020). Concerningly, this has been most acute in the deciduous dipterocarp forests in the lowlands favoured by this species, especially in Cambodia and southern Lao PDR, and in both countries rapid declines are suspected to have occurred over the last 20 years, and even by then the species' population size was only a small fraction of its historic baseline. In Lao PDR, and possibly also Myanmar and Viet Nam, gun and projectile hunting is thought to have contributed to (at least historic) declines (M. Lammertink&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2012, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). Moreover, in Lao PDR, hydroelectric power plants have flooded considerable areas of lowland forest (Soukhaphon <em>et al</em>. 2021). In Myanmar, Bangladesh and parts of India, selective logging, even in nominally protected areas, continues and presumably is driving (at least slow) population declines as elsewhere in the species' range, although data are sparse. In the Himalayan foothills, clearance for sal&#160;<em>Shorea robusta&#160;</em>plantations continues and is likely driving slow declines (Kumar and Shahabuddin 2012), although these are not typically in global strongholds.","The global population size of this species was estimated by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. (2009) to lie somewhere in the broad range of 26,000 to 550,000 mature individuals, a figure derived from an initial remote-sensing based analysis which yielded an estimate of 260,000-550,000, but with an adjusted lower bound (reduced by 90%) to reflect occupancy and the insensitivities of the land cover data used. If these numbers were accurate for 2005 as proposed, then the suspected population decline of 25-49% (best estimate 35–49%) since 2005 (see Population Trend text) yields an adjusted total in 2023 of 13,260–412,500 (best estimate 13,260–357,500). A bespoke internal analysis using land cover data from 2010 (with totals adjusted for forest loss rates since) and an approximate density of 0.5–5 birds/km<sup>2</sup> (reflecting a range of densities recorded by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. [2009] and by Kumar and Shahabuddin [2012]) suggests a similar global population of 12,750–63,750. This alternative total is congruent with the scenarios provided by Lammertink <em>et al</em>. (2009) but suggests that their more pessimistic scenarios were likely more accurate. Accordingly, but reflecting the great uncertainty in the population size of this species, the total is set here to 10,000-70,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Mulleripicus pulverulentus </em>is found in South-East Asia, from northern <strong>India</strong> through the foothills of the Himalaya (including, locally, <strong>Nepal </strong>and <strong>Bhutan</strong>)&#160;to southern <strong>China</strong>,<strong> Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Lao PDR</strong>,<strong> Viet Nam</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong> and <strong>Thailand</strong>, and through Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong>&#160;to Sumatra (<strong>Indonesia</strong>), Borneo,&#160;and Palawan,&#160;<strong>Philippines</strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2002, Inskipp <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2011, Allen 2020, eBird 2023).

Due to their wide geographic range, secretive nature and habitat tolerance, Leopards are difficult to categorize as a single species. Evidence suggests that Leopard populations have been dramatically reduced due to continued persecution from increased human populations (Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013, Selvan <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Abade <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Bleyhl&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2021); habitat fragmentation (UN 2014); increased illegal wildlife trade (Datta&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Rostro-Garcia&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016); excessive harvesting for medicinal use and ceremonial use of skins, spiritual and cultural use of the body parts including skin, claws, teeth, tail, paws, skin and fat (Naude&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020); prey base declines (Hatton <em>et al. </em>2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari and Carpaneto 2006, Datta&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014, Selvan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014); and poorly managed trophy hunting (Balme&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). Throughout North, East (specifically the Horn of Africa) and West Africa, Middle East, East and Southeast Asia, Leopards have suffered marked reductions and regional extirpations due to poaching for illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and prey loss. Human populations are increasing by 2.7 percent annually in sub-Saharan Africa according to the UN. Between 2022 and 2050, the fastest human population growth is projected to occur in Africa. The population in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double by 2050 (https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population). The rate of cropland expansion accelerated in Africa over the past two decades. There was a more than twofold increase from 2016–2019 compared to 2004–2007. Countries in West, Central, and East Africa all saw large increases in cultivated land. Most of those new croplands were carved out of natural habitats rather than pasture or abandoned farmland (<a href=""https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149624/crop-expansion-accelerates-in-africa"">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149624/crop-expansion-accelerates-in-africa</a>). Deforestation in southeast Asia has increased for palm oil and rubber plantations (Sodhi&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010, Miettinen <em>et al.</em> 2011). Intensive snaring for bushmeat in southeast Asia has substantially reduced Leopard prey and caused direct mortality (Rostro-Garcia&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2023). Since the last assessment in 2016, evidence of genetic inbreeding among isolated populations has presented an additional threat to population viability (Marchenkova <em>et al. </em>2020, Cho&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022, Yin&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2023). <br/><br/>We estimate the current confirmed extant range of Leopards presented in this assessment (7,608,096 km², see map) is a reduction of 11% from the previous assessment from 2016 (8,515,935 km², Stein <em>et al. </em>2016). Range losses in sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, Southeast Asia and China counterbalance gains in India and Southwest Asia (Ostrowski&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022). Only in Northeast China and Russian Far East the leopard’s breeding range increased during 20 years from 7,000 km² to 14,000 km² (Jiang&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016, Vitkalova&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2023). Though our knowledge of the Leopard distribution is better today than in 2016, it is still limited at the national, regional and range-wide scales because reliable data on Leopard population trends are missing from large portions of their range. We suspect that suitable Leopard range has been reduced by &gt;30% worldwide in the last three generations (22.3 years). We calculated generation length as 7.42 years (based on the formula presented in Pacifici <em>et al. </em>2013 and data from wild Leopard populations presented in Balme <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Leopard population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Leopard prey species, small, medium-size and large wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007). Prey species are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013, Ripple&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016, Rogan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017). A commercialized bushmeat trade has caused an estimated 59% average decline in Leopard prey populations across 78 protected areas in West, East and southern Africa between 1970 and 2005 (Craigie&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010). In southern Africa, illegal bushmeat hunting removes up to 620,000 kg of wild ungulates annually from the Okavango Delta, Botswana (Rogan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017). Though ungulate populations have increased by 24% in southern Africa, potential prey numbers have declined by 52% in East Africa and 85% in West Africa (Craigie&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010). Bushmeat poaching in Mozambique (Hatton&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001, Fusari&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006) and Zambia (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014) has severely reduced Leopard prey (Becker&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013) inside and outside of protected areas. Many wildlife areas are suffering from substantial ungulate decline, including Zambian Game Management Areas and National Parks, maintain large mammal populations at 93.7% and 74.1% below estimated carrying capacity, respectively (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014). With such reductions to Leopard prey, we infer a &gt;50% loss of Leopard populations across East and West Africa within three generations. Through extensive poaching pressure also in Asia, many prey species, such as Sambar Deer in Malaysia, are threatened with regional extirpation throughout tropical forest systems (Corbett 2007, Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014). Moreover, in Golestan National Park, Iran, the main prey of Persian Leopard declined by 66–89% since the 1970s due to poaching, with the only increase in prey population observed in Wild Boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), which is not being hunted due to religious beliefs (Ghoddousi&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>In South-east and East Asia, intensive snaring and poaching for Leopard prey and targeted Leopard hunts for the wildlife trade market are taking place. The Indian Leopard is widespread, though somewhat fragmented outside protected areas and thus an easy target for illegal wildlife trade (Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023). In 2018 alone, 90 Leopard poaching events were reported. A lot of the poaching incidents likely go unreported (Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023). A regional survey found that Leopards in India have been poached at a rate of four individuals per week for the illegal wildlife trade (Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012b). Nowell and Pervushina (2014) found the illegal trade of Leopard parts was comparable to that of Tigers in Asian range States and derivative seizures with an average of 3.5 Leopards seizure cases per month in India since 2000. Data suggest that the illegal trade in Leopard skins for cultural regalia is rampant in southern Africa (Naude&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020b).<br/><br/>Poorly managed trophy hunting adds to pressure on local Leopard populations. Balme&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2009) showed that trophy hunting was a key driver of Leopard population decline prior to intervention in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Similarly, Pitman <em>et al.</em> (2015) demonstrated that Leopards are over-harvested across much of their range in Limpopo Province, South Africa. In 2022, Muller&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2022) used web-sourced images of Leopard trophy hunts and showed that hunting violations were occurring in southern Africa, including non-permitted hunting of female Leopards in South Africa and Zambia, and illegal hounding in Namibia and South Africa. In recent years, concerns about unsustainable trophy hunting has led to temporary bans in South Africa (2016–2018), Zimbabwe and Botswana (2013–2022). In these countries, hunting has been reinstated (2015). Taken all together, the Leopard meets the A2cd criterion for Vulnerable, based on loss of habitat, prey depletion, and exploitation. These causes of the suspected reduction are neither fully documented nor fully understood; they have not ceased, and are likely to continue, and future decline is anticipated unless conservation efforts are taken.","<strong>Habitat Types and Range</strong><br/>Leopards occur in the widest range of habitats among any of the Old-World Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). They are found in the desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa in Namibia and Botswana. There are remnant populations in the arid regions of North Africa in Egypt, as well as the Arabian Peninsula. They persist in rugged montane regions of southwest Asia in Iran, in a varied range of landscapes in India and in the savanna grasslands of East and southern Africa. Leopards live in mountainous environments up to an altitude of 4,600 m on Mt. Kenya and 5,200 m in the Himalayas. They also thrive in the rainforests of West and Central Africa as well as Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. A remnant Leopard subpopulation also persists in the temperate coniferous-broadleaf forests in snowy regions of the Russian Far-East and North-East China. Leopard subpopulations also occur in suburban and urban environments in India and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Leopards have survived outside protected areas in many parts of India since historical times (Daniel 1999) and even today high density of Leopards does occur among high human densities (Singh 2005, Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2013), although associated levels of conflict can also be high (Athreya<em> et al. </em>2011). <br/><br/>Leopards prefer to hunt in areas that provide sufficient cover despite higher prey densities elsewhere when sympatric with larger competitors (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2006). <br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong><br/>Leopard diet is related to prey availability and presence of larger competitors. Generally, Leopards prefer medium-sized ungulate prey (10–40 kgs) where available (Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2006). They have a highly varied diet, however, feeding on insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals up to large ungulates. Though the Leopard as a species has the reputation of being a generalist, often individuals will become adept specialists for a particular prey item. These individuals will feed almost exclusively on that prey, occasionally supplementing their diet with other food items when necessary. Where competitors are present, Leopards will cache their kills under thick vegetation or hoist their prey into the limbs of a tree. Hoisting behaviour is more often recorded where intraguild competitor density is higher. Male Leopards tend to hoist more often than females, particularly in the dry season when available ground cover is scarce (Stein <em>et al. </em>2015). In the absence of larger competitors, leopards feed on larger prey (Ramakrishnan <em>et al.</em> 1999, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In many parts of its range, the importance of domestic animals in their diet is also evident with dogs, goats and cattle forming a large proportion of their diet (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2001) sometimes even dominating the wild prey items in the diet (Athreya <em>et al. </em>2014, Shehzad <em>et al.</em> 2014). Dogs have been reported as important prey for Leopards (Edgaonkar and Chellam 2002, Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2014). Overall studies on diet of Leopards are very scant across its Asian range. However, a number of dietary studies across the Persian Leopard range show the importance of wild mountain ungulates (80-95% of consumed biomass) such as the Bezoar Goat (<em>Capra aegagrus</em>) and Urial (<em>Ovis vignei</em>; Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2018, Ghoddousi <em>et al. </em>2016 ) as well as the Wild Boar when other prey species are depleted (Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Home Range Size</strong><br/>Leopard home range size varies with prey availability and habitat structure. Leopards have the largest ranges within arid and semi-arid environs where prey density is low. The largest recorded Leopard ranges include the Central Kalahari (mean = 2,182 km², Bothma <em>et al. </em>1997). The smallest recorded ranges correspond to rainforest habitats in south and southeast Asia. In Thailand, Grassman (1999) recorded home ranges as small as 8.8 km² for a female and an average 17.7 km² for two adult males. In India, three collared Leopards in human dominated landscapes exhibited home range sizes between 8 and 15 km² (Odden <em>et al.</em> 2014).","The primary threats to Leopards are anthropogenic. Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming, poaching and illegal trade have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005, Hunter 2013, Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023, Al Hikmani <em>et al.</em> 2023, Ghoddousi and Khorozyan 2023). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching, thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.<br/><br/>Where livestock and game farms have been created, Leopards may feed on these commercially valuable prey species causing conflicts with farmers. These farmers may be intolerant to Leopard conflict and kill the Leopards for real or perceived threats to their lives and livelihoods (Stein <em>et al.</em> 2010, Athreya&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2011). A recent study estimated that 54% of Leopard mortalities in Iran are in response to livestock depredation (Soofi&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022).<br/><br/>Leopards are also targets for trophy hunting. If poorly managed, trophy hunting can be detrimental to the population, especially when permits are focused in one geographic area and targeted individuals are in their prime, territorial, reproductively active (Balme&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010b). Leopard trophy hunting has been reviewed or closed in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia within the last five years.<br/><br/>In Indo-Malaya and China, Leopards require better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007, Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023) and recent reports estimate very high levels of Leopard removal at four individuals per week for 10 years (Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012b). Leopards are also killed for their skins used in traditional ceremonies and other parts for medicinal use in eastern cultures and spiritual beliefs in African cultures. These trades can have a substantial impact on local Leopard populations.<br/><br/><em><strong></strong></em><em><strong>Genetics</strong></em><br/>We have changed our subspecies listing of Leopards from nine to eight based on morphological traits, molecular and biogeographic information (Miththapala <em>et al.</em> 1996, Uphyrkina<em> et al.</em> 2001, Kitchener <em>et al. </em>2017). Despite their wide range, Leopards in Africa (<em>P. p. pardus</em>) show little differentiation between populations (Anco&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017, Pečnerová <em>et al</em>. 2021). There is a deep divergence between the African and all Asian Leopard subspecies (dated to 500–600 kya), followed by much more shallow divergence between the Asian lineages (Paaijmans <em>et al. </em>2021). Within Asia, three main lineages are identified, roughly differentiating the East Asian subspecies <em>P. p. orientalis</em>, <em>P. p. delacouri</em> and <em>P. p. melas</em>, the Central Asian subspecies <em>P. p. fusca</em> and <em>P. p. kotiya</em>, and the West Asian subspecies <em>P. p. tulliana </em>(the subspecies <em>P. p. nimr</em> was not included in this study; Paijmans <em>et al.</em> 2021). Although the samples from individual subspecies seem to group together, with the exception of an unresolved relationship between <em>P. p. fusca</em> and <em>P. p. kotiya</em>, detailed inferences are challenging due to the low numbers of sampling localities in this study (Paijmans&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2021). Recent trends have shown a substantial reduction in Leopard range throughout West and Central Africa, South-east Asia and China; thus, we express concern about the loss of leopard diversity through local extinction of unique genetic lineages. These lineages may carry adaptations to local environments, which are crucial to conserve for maintaining resilient populations. The loss of potentially adaptive diversity is particularly concerning in the face of rapidly changing climate and further isolation of populations. In addition, small and isolated population may face the threat of inbreeding depression. For the Amur population leopard there have been cases of physical deformities due to low genetic viability (Marchenkova <em>et al.</em> 2020, Vitkalova <em>et al. </em>2023). Monitoring populations specifically to detect decreasing fitness, e.g. through low fecundity or high cub mortality, may further provide indications of inbreeding depression.","Highly adaptable and widely distributed, Leopards can persist in areas where other large carnivores have been extirpated. However, Leopards are declining throughout most of their range (Jacobson<em> et al. </em>2016). There are no robust estimates of the total number of mature individuals’ range-wide, but several Asian subspecies were assessed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List in 2016 and should retain these listings in 2023 based on the following population estimates and population trends:<ul><li>Amur Leopard (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>): Critically Endangered (C2a(ii); D, Jackson and Nowell 2008).</li><li>Amur population: CR C2a(ii): about 129–130 mature individuals (Wen <em>et al. </em>2022, Vitkalova<em> et al. </em>2023, Y.

Across the majority of range, Leopards have declined substantially (&gt;30%) over the last three generations as determined by extensive population surveys, expert input and indirect measures supporting our conclusion that Leopards remain listed as Vulnerable (criteria A2cd). Over the past three generations (22.3 years) regional Leopard populations in the Middle East, East and South-east Asia, West, parts of Central and East Africa have seen substantial range declines due to habitat fragmentation and forest clearing, prey reductions from the bushmeat trade, illegal harvest for skins and human-wildlife conflict and retaliation for livestock depredation. Leopards have completely disappeared from regions of North Africa where they were recorded in the previous assessment. Greater survey efforts in Java have identified 22 subpopulations (Wibisono <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the Caucasus, Leopards have maintained their populations or increased due to improved survey methods, expanded range or intensive conservation efforts. In Russian Far East and North East China, the transboundary population and its range has increased substantially due to creation of large national parks with good protection (details see Vitkalova <em>et al.</em> 2023). Although Leopard range has expanded due to greater survey techniques, the whole Indian Leopard population is suspected to have decreased by 24.5% over the last three generations (details see Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023).<br/><br/>A predictive model was created using 392 leopard estimates range-wide to generate a global population estimate of 261,636 individuals (interquartile range of 146,768– 461,512; Pranzini <em>et al. </em>2023). This estimate and subspecies estimates are higher than those provided by individual subspecies assessments and represent a strong baseline from which a revised estimate can be generated. <br/><br/><strong>AFRICA</strong><br/>There are few reliable data on changes in the Leopard (<em>P. p. pardus</em>) status (distribution or abundance) throughout Africa over the last three generations, although there is compelling evidence that subpopulations have likely declined considerably. Robust longitudinal data on 47 Lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) subpopulations—a sympatric large carnivore—demonstrated a 42% decline in abundance across populations in the last three generations (22.3 yrs) (Balm<em>e et al.</em> 2013). Lion population trends decreased in West, Central and East Africa, and increased in Southern Africa. Most of the factors driving Lion population declines (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to conflict, poorly managed trophy hunting) also affect Leopards. Indeed, pressure on Leopard populations is likely greater as a larger proportion of their range extends beyond protected areas. The increase in Lion populations in southern Africa was primarily due to the reintroduction of &gt;800 Lions to small, protected reserves in South Africa. Similar reintroductions were undertaken for Leopards (Briers-Louw and Leslie 2017). Fencing of protected areas was proposed as another significant factor contributing to the increase in Lion numbers in southern Africa (Packer<em> et al. </em>2013). In contrast, fences are far less effective at reducing detrimental edge effects of ‘protected' Leopard populations (Balme<em> et al. </em>2010a) and a far greater proportion of Leopard range falls outside protected areas (Swanepoel<em> et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>One main factor for Leopard declines in Africa is related to prey declines. Leopard population density across Africa is known to track the biomass of their principle prey species, medium and large-sized wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey<em> et al. </em>2013). Time series data from 1970 to 2005 on the main Leopard prey species in 78 protected areas in West, East and Southern Africa, revealed a 59% average decline in population abundance across the three regions. While ungulate and other large mammal populations increased by 24% in southern Africa, they declined by 52% in East Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Considering the Leopard’s dependence on wild prey species within its African range, concomitant Leopard declines in the same order of magnitude (&gt;50%) in West and East Africa can be inferred for the same time frame.<br/><br/>Another main driver of range loss and population decline of Leopards in Africa is habitat loss. Leopards have limited levels of ecological resilience to human-caused habitat fragmentation in Africa, and as a result are more restricted to conservation areas. Although male Leopards can successfully traverse fragmented and suboptimal habitat (Fattebert <em>et al.</em> 2013), in general Leopards in Africa require large contiguous habitats with low human impacts to reproduce successfully (Balme<em> et al. </em>2010a). However, in 2022, the population of sub-Saharan Africa has grown by 2.5 percent annually, more than three times the global average of 0.8 percent annually with a predicted population increase from 1.152 billion today to 2.094 billion by 2050 (UNDESA 2023), which in conjunction with a 57% increase in agriculture areas (from just over 200 million ha to almost 340 million ha) from 1975 to 2000 and a 21% decrease in natural vegetation in the region (Brink and Eva 2009) likely have negatively impacted the leopard populations. These increases in human population and habitat fragmentation were not accounted for in the previous assessment. As a subspecies<em> P. p. pardus </em>potentially qualifies as Vulnerable due to suspected population declines.<br/><br/>Although African Leopards can be regarded as a single genetic grouping for now (Anco <em>et al. </em>2017, Pečnerová <em>et al. </em>2021), geographically they are subject to different pressures that require area-specific categorizations and conservation status assessments. Therefore, we subdivided the African continent into regional units for more detailed and specific status assessments:<br/><br/><strong>North Africa</strong>: Leopards have not been documented in North Africa and likely remain extirpated. The Egyptian occurrence is considered very small, with no new documented evidence since the last assessment in Elba National Park in southeastern Egypt, and still no recorded signs in Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2023). Therefore, the North African subpopulation while likely extinct potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered on the basis of a very small and declining number of mature individuals, and a full assessment is recommended.<br/><br/><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong>: Numbers of sub-Saharan Leopards are declining within large portions of their range, particularly outside of protected areas. The populations within West, parts of Central and East Africa are decreasing significantly with increasing fragmentation and isolation throughout. In southern Africa, a large continuous population occurs through the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area extending across northern and central Namibia, all of Botswana into northern South Africa. However, large areas of northern Angola, Zambia (outside of protected areas), Mozambique, central Zimbabwe and central South Africa appear to be decreasing from previous estimates with Leopards disappearing from areas with increased human development and areas of intensive conflict with humans (R. Groom, P. Funston, M. Becker, A. Jorge and A. Loveridge pers. comm. 2023). Although urbanization is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (UNDESA 2023), the majority of the population is rural, and about 60–70% of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods, mostly at a subsistence level. As a result, a large portion of the growing human population is expected to depend directly on expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing to survive. By 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to more than double to &gt;2 billion (UN 2023), and the area of cultivated land is project to increase by 51 million ha (approximately 21%, Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012), which likely will contribute to the continued population decline of Leopards in Africa. In the absence of proactive management, populations of Leopards and other large carnivores generally decline in concert with increased human population growth (Woodroffe 2000, Linnell <em>et al. </em>2001). In summary, the combination of widespread habitat loss (21% in sub-Saharan Africa in 25 years) and prey loss inside African protected areas (59% decline) is likely to have caused concomitant Leopard declines of &gt;30% over the last three Leopard generations. The Leopard subpopulation of sub-Saharan Africa still qualifies as VU (Criterion A2cd).<br/><br/>Additionally, we strongly recommend detailed status assessments for different parts of Africa to address regional needs and requirements (e.g. Henschel <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/><strong>ASIA</strong><br/><strong>Indian Leopard</strong> (<em style="""">P. p. fusca</em>): The known range of the Indian Leopard has increased compared to the previous assessment, but this is likely due to more intensive surveys conducted in previously unstudied wild and suburban environments. Nevertheless, the data on population size and trend of the Indian Leopard population across its whole range is still poor (Shivakumar<em> et al.</em> 2023). Poaching for wildlife trade is still a threat to Indian Leopards (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008, Shivakumar<em> et al. </em>2023). For example, Raza <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated that four Leopards per week have been poached for illegal wildlife trade over the previous 10 years. Additionally, high conflict is reported in some areas resulting in lethal control of problem individuals (Athreya<em> et al. </em>2013). Continuous decreases in wild prey are negatively impacting Leopard numbers in some regions (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008, Selvan <em>et al. </em>2014), indicating Leopard populations may decline in the future. Moreover, even in well protected areas, the recovery of Tiger numbers often results in lower Leopard numbers (Harihar <em>et al. </em>2011, Mondal <em>et al.</em> 2012), as Tigers are known to kill and displace Leopards (McDougal 1988, Odden <em>et al. </em>2010). The first ever scientific national census of Leopards around Tiger habitats in India (except the northeast) in 2014 estimated 7,910 individuals, with a speculated national total of 12,000–14,000 (Bhattacharya 2015). In 2018, 12,852 Leopards were estimated in the Tiger Landscapes of India with likely over 15,000 across India (Jhala <em>et al. </em>2020, Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023). The 2018 census indicates a population increase from the estimate in 2014 due to more comprehensive sampling (Jhala<em> et al.</em> 2020). The trend in non-Tiger States of India and in non-forested Leopard habitats is however not known and there are also indications for a decreasing population trend (Bhatt <em>et al. </em>2020). Based on all the information available, the Indian Leopard was assessed as Near Threatened under Criterion A2cd based on a suspected population reduction of 24.5% over the last three generations (Shivakuma<em>r et al. </em>2023). The decline is suspected from range loss and inferred based on actual or potential levels of exploitation. There are, however, also areas with positive population trends (Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023).<br/><br/><u><strong>Chinese leopard</strong> (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>, combined into one subspecies with <em>P. p. japonensis</em>)</u>: Even with the two subspecies recently combining&#160;to one, according to Kitchener <em>et al.</em> (2017), the last existing populations of Changbai Mountains and Loess Plateau in Central China were separated by 1,700 km of highly converted lands, including almost impassable for leopard 140 km wide break along Liaohe River. From this point of view, it makes sense to describe them separately at the population level.<br/><br/>The state of the most northern Amur population (described previously as Amur leopard,&#160;<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) has improved significantly. At the end the 20 century the last 27–32 Amur leopards inhabited Southwest Primorsky province of Russian Far East (Pikunov <em>et al. </em>2009, Murzin and Miquelle 2000). In nearby Laoyeling Mountains of Northeast China they were maximum 7–12 leopards (Yang <em>et al. </em>1998, Sun <em>et al. </em>1999). Due to the strong conservation measures total population was doubled since previous IUCN assessment. In 2014–2015, the joint camera-trap photo database counted the total Sino-Russian population minimum as 64–67 individually defined animals, including 5–8 cubs. The average density was 1.40 sp. per 100 km²<sup> </sup>on Russian side and 0.16 on Chinese side, while model-averaged SECR estimates predict 84 adults and sub-adults (Vitkalova<em> et al. </em>2018). Because, they are no exchange of camera trap data since 2016, we can only calculate possible size of the Amur leopard global population, summing the last available results of national surveys. In 2019, they were 49 individually defined adult leopard in North East China (Wen <em>et al.</em> 2022) and 105 adults in Russian Far East (Vitkalova <em>et al.</em> 2023). Adding the country-specific abundance estimates, thus ignoring individual movement across the border, overestimated abundance compared to the combined analyses by 18.0–21.5% (Vitkalova <em>et al. </em>2018, Shevtsova<em> et al. </em>2018). So, the Amur leopard global population can be estimated to 128–130 adult and sub-adult leopards (Yu. Darman, pers. comm. 2023). A key conservation achievements were the creation of Land of the Leopard National Park in Russia and North-East Tiger and Leopard National Park in China. The Sino-Russian network of protected areas has been increased 12 times during 25 years, from 1,532 km² to 18,045 km², covering 90% of current range of Amur leopard population. Implementation of SMART law enforcement provided a means of monitoring and improving law enforcement efforts, resulting in a consistent decline in poaching events. An ungulate recovery program, including mineral licks and supplemental winter forage to prevent large-scale winter die-offs, ensured a sufficient and increasing prey base. Even the improvement of protection and increase of prey base, the Amur population face with inbreeding problem, already resulting in physical deformities (Marchenkova <em>et al. </em>2020, Choi <em>et al. </em>2021, Vitkalova <em>et al. </em>2023). The proposed large-scale re-introduction program based on animals from captivity (Miquelle<em> et al.</em> 2010) is delayed. Instead, the re-location of leopards from existing population in Land of the Leopard national park was started in 2023 (Yu. Darman, pers. comm. 2023).<br/><br/><u><strong>North China leopard population </strong>(previously described as <em>P. p. japonensis</em> but subsumed by Kitchener<em> et al. </em>2017 as <em>P. p. orientalis</em>)</u>: This population is restricted to small, isolated protected areas in two separated meta-populations in Central China (Hebei, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, northern Henan) and South-West China (western Sichuan, southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet regions) (Laguardia <em>et al.</em> 2017, Vitekere<em> et al.</em> 2021, Wang<em> et al. </em>2021). About 96–98 % of the North Chinese leopard habitat has been lost compared to historical conditions (Xie <em>et al.</em> 2018) and it is listed Chinese National Class I Key Protected Wildlife (Song <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Loess Plateau is the core distribution area of North China leopard with the largest and densest population in the remaining forests of the Ziwuling Mountains in the central part of the region (Yang<em> et al. </em>2021). In Tieqiaoshan Provincial Nature Reserve (Shanxi province) the recapturing model estimates that the population density of North China leopard in 2017–2019 was high enough—4.23 per 100 km² (Zhu<em> et al.</em> 2021). The microsatellite results of 22 DNA identified leopards in Loess Plateau (Yin <em>et al. </em>2023) showed significant genetic differentiation of populations on both sides of the Yellow River. Leopards from Tieqiaoshan Provincial Nature Reserve in the Shanxi province (North from Yellow River) showed a significantly lower genetic diversity and a severe inbreeding decline compared to animals from Ziwuling Nature Reserve (Shaanxi Province) and Liupanshan Nature Reserve (Ningxia Province). Yellow River with its wide belt of converted lands is the main cause of the divergence of the original North China leopard populations and they should be set up into two conservation management units, between which there are no direct ecological corridor connection (Yin <em>et al. </em>2023). Across Central China subpopulations are small (&lt;50 individuals) and fragmented, and occur mainly in isolated nature reserves, indicating some subpopulations may not be viable in the long-term. Reasons for their decline include retaliatory killings due to conflict, poaching for wildlife trade, low prey numbers (especially ungulates), genetic inbreeding, habitat loss and fragmentation (Laguardia<em> et al. </em>2017, Vitekere<em> et al. </em>2021, Paijmans<em> et al. </em>2021).<br/><br/><u><strong>Indochinese Leopard </strong>(classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. delacouri</em>):</u> The most recent review showed an even greater reduction in range for Leopards in South-east Asia (Rostro-García<em> et al. </em>2019). This subspecies is now likely extinct in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Singapore, with strongholds remaining in Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand (Rostro-Garcia pers. comm. 2023). Populations persist in border forests in Thailand and southern China, including both Yunnan in the southwest and southeastern China, resulting in a total estimated population &lt;114-1,130 individuals for all of Southeast Asia (Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2019). Targeted poaching for wildlife trade and snaring for bushmeat remain the greatest factor that contributed to the recent range collapse of Leopards in South-east Asia. Leopard parts are used as substitutes for Tiger parts for medicinal purposes in China and South-east Asia, and Leopard skins are highly sought after as luxury items (Rostro-Garcia<em> et al. </em>2023). Poachers in South-east Asia can get up to $3,000 for a Leopard carcass (S. Prum and R. Maharjan pers. comms. 2014), and this price likely will continue to increase. Other important factors include depletion of prey base, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout all South-east Asian countries and southeastern China, primate and large (&gt;5 kg) ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Johnson <em>et al. </em>2006, Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014), which may hinder recovery of Leopards in the region. Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to Leopards in South-east Asia, particularly because these are closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. The deforestation rate in South-east Asia is the highest of all tropical regions, and the rate is still increasing (Sodhi <em>et al. </em>2010, Miettinen <em>et al.</em> 2011). From 2000 to 2010, areas of primary or secondary forests decreased in all Southeast Asian countries, most of which was due to conversion to palm oil and rubber plantations, as the price of these commodities increased 130% and 333%, respectively, during the same period (Wilcove <em>et al.</em> 2013). Because &lt;10% of South-east Asian forests are under some form of protection, and prices of luxury wood, palm oil, and rubber are expected to increase, habitat loss in the region is expected to continue (Sodhi <em>et al. </em>2010) and thus likely to have negative impacts on the leopard populations. The Indochinese Leopard (<em>P. p. delacouri</em>) is assessed as Critically Endangered under A2b+3b+4b (Rostro-García <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/><u><strong>Persian Leopard</strong> (<em>P. p. tulliana</em>)</u>: The entire Leopard population in this region is estimated to be around 750–1,044 individuals (Ghoddousi and Khorozyan 2023) with around 83% of which (528–732) in Iran (Farhadinia<em> et al.</em> 2022, Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2022). The largest continuous Leopard hotspot across Asia occurs in Northern Iran and Central Asia which is estimated between 348–440 individuals (Farhardinia<em> et al.</em> 2022). Around 60–80 individuals are estimated to be in the Kopetdag region of Turkmenistan (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2022). The current population of leopards in Kazakhstan varies between 0 and 5 (Red Book of Endangered Species, Kazakhstan 2021). The minimum population identified in the South Caucasus from camera trap images is 6–17 (including 3–9 cubs) in Azerbaijan and 3–9 in Armenia (Khorozyan<em> et al. </em>2022). In Iraqi Kurdistan, the nine adult individuals are identified (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2023). At the site level, Tandoureh and Golestan national parks in Iran with 30 and 20 adult detected individuals detected from camera traps, respectively, hold the largest populations of Persian Leopards across the entire range (Farhadinia<em> et al. </em>2022, Hamidi <em>et al.</em> 2014). The western range of Persian leopard lays along Zagros Mountains spanning between Iran, Iraq and Turkey, but often in smaller populations, varying between 1.0-1.9 leopard/100 km² in density (Ghoddousi<em> et al. </em>2010, Farhadinia<em> et al. </em>2021). Other protected areas in Iran with the extant population of Persian Leopard identified through camera trapping or DNA fingerprinting include Dena National Park (18 individuals), Salouk National Park (11), Bamu National Park (5–11), Sarigol National (10), Kiasar National Park (10), Bafq Protected Area (5–8), North Alborz Protected Area (7), Parvar Protected Area (7), and Bakhtegan National Park (6) (Farhadinia<em> et al. </em>2021, 2022; Ghoddousi <em>et al. </em>2010, 2022 ). The density of Leopards in northeastern Iran was reported to vary between 2.63 and 8.86 individuals/100 km² (Farhadinia<em> et al. </em>2019, Hamidi <em>et al.</em> 2014). Moreover, 18 individuals (2015–2019) had been identified in unprotected lands in the East of Hormozgan Province, Iran (Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2022) but a follow-up camera trap survey revealed the persistence of only 11 individuals and at least three Leopards killed due to conflict (M. Arianejad pers. comm. 2021). Overall Persian Leopard populations estimates are not available due to four decades of unrest in Afghanistan. Records from retaliatory killing and other random trapping records by impacted communities indicate the presence of a substantial number and a widespread distribution of Leopards in Afghanistan (Ostrowski <em>et al.</em> 2022).<br/><br/><strong>Other subspecies</strong>: Leopards of the Arabian Peninsula (<em>P. p. nimr </em>requires listing as Critically Endangered due to low population numbers and population fragmentation. The Arabian Leopard is assessed as Critically Endangered under C2a(i) with only 70–84 mature individuals remaining in two main subpopulations in Oman and Yemen (Al Hikmani <em>et al.</em> 2023). The subpopulations in Oman and Yemen each only contain around 50 mature individuals and are severely fragmented and declining (Al Hikmani <em>et al.</em> 2023). The Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) is assessed as Vulnerable under D1 with a declining population. The Javan Leopard (<em>P. p. melas</em>), is listed as Endangered (but very close to Critically Endangered) under C2a(i) with only 319 mature individuals left, less than 50 mature individuals in each subpopulation and with a continuously declining population (Wibisono<em> et al. </em>2021). <br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> We acknowledge that additional data could reveal an increase or decrease in population size or range loss of Leopards, thus the status could change for segments of Leopard range as more data are collected.",Decreasing,"Our assessment of Leopard distribution has been divided into two geographic regions: Africa and Asia. In order to describe these regions, we have further divided Leopard distribution into sub-regions to address local population trends.<br/><br/>The distribution map for Africa is based on point data (records with coordinates) divided into pre year 2000 and post year 2000 data and further subdivided into C1 (hard fact, verified records), C2 (expert-confirmed records) and C3 (not verifiable data) according to the SCALP categories for the Leopard. Most of these records (several thousand in total) came from peer-reviewed literature, but also from grey literature and Internet search engines (see Supplementary Information). To delineate the current distribution in Africa, we used C1 and C2 records from 2000 onwards and adjacent areas of potential suitable leopard habitat (i.e., results of habitat model prediction). Finally, we used existing local range maps and absence data from various local surveys to refine the distribution boundaries. In addition, land cover data and expert opinion were used, particularly in areas with no recent records due to the lack of scientific research.<br/><br/>The distribution map for Asia is based on the IUCN Red List Assessments for the Asian subspecies and the data originating from the Cat News Special Issue Nr 15 “The Persian Leopard” (see Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Using IUCN Red List mapping guidelines, we categorized leopard range into extant, possibly extant, possibly extinct, and extinct.<br/><strong><br/>Leopards in Africa</strong><br/>Leopards in Africa have seen the largest reduction in range since the previous assessment, partially because their Asian counterparts had already lost significant range, but also because there is increasing pressure on leopards particularly in West, Central and East Africa. We suggest that regional assessments be conducted to identify and highlight challenges and differences in conservation status.<br/><br/><u><strong>North Africa</strong>:</u> Leopard distribution in North Africa has been extirpated from 100% of their former range. It is unclear if there are still any remnant, isolated populations remaining at all (Durant<em> et al. </em>2014). An adult male Leopard was killed in the Elba region of southeastern Egypt in retaliation for livestock depredation, though evidence of a breeding population is still uncertain (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2014). Continued camera-trapping efforts have failed to capture the presence of Leopard in the Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). Leopards are thought to be extirpated from Morocco (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/><u><strong>West Africa</strong>:</u> Leopard distribution in West Africa has been dramatically reduced. This reduction is likely due to habitat fragmentation, illegal killing of Leopards and their prey, but also to more rigorous survey efforts that have confirmed presence and likely absence across the region (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2023). Since the previous assessment, Leopard range has become increasingly fragmented with some of the larger subpopulations divided into smaller fragments. Leopards have been confirmed in Niger along the southwestern border with Benin and Burkina Faso (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014), but previous reports in Aïr and Ténéré National Reserves are unconfirmed. Leopards are generally restricted to a few protected areas from Senegal in the west to Nigeria in the east. Leopards have been reported in the south of Senegal including Parc National de Niokolo-Koba In Guinea Bissau, Leopards are present in the Dulombi and Boé National Parks, as well as the linking corridor of Tchetche, whereas they are now scarce in the rest of the country (in the southwest) or rare and localized (rest of the hinterland, L. Palma, pers. comm. 2023). In Sierra Leone, there are possibly only very small remnant populations near Outamba Kilimi National Park and Gola National Forest as well as the eastern boundary with Guinea/ Liberia left. Leopard populations in Liberia have been recorded in Lofa-Mano National Park in the west and Sapo National Park in the east, but their status is unclear. In Ghana, Leopards are found along the boundary with Côte d’Ivoire and Mole National Park in the north and west though connectivity between these parks has likely been cut off because of fragmentation (P. Henschel and M. Drouilly pers. comm. 2023). In Côte d’Ivoire, leopards are present in Taï National Park (probably the highest density in West Africa, M. Drouilly pers. comm. 2023) and in Comoé National Park in the north. In Benin, Leopard are found along the northern boundary. Leopards are nearly absent from most of Nigeria and southern Mali.<br/><br/><u><strong>Central Africa</strong>:</u> Leopard numbers have decreased throughout Central Africa due to deforestation, illegal hunting for skins and snaring. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Leopard range was largely reduced in areas of increased human influence and areas relatively easy to access and therefore open to illegal hunting and bushmeat trade. Large portions of remaining forests in the northern region of the country have extant Leopard populations, however, Leopard populations are increasingly isolated in the south. In Cameroon, Leopards are found in the northern and southeastern portions of the country with possibly extant region potentially connecting them. The southern extant population connects to neighbouring countries: Gabon, Congo, and the southwestern corner of the Central African Republic (CAR). In Gabon, Leopards are found throughout the country with small absent pockets in the north. Leopards have likely lost ground in southern Congo. In the Central African Republic (CAR), Leopards are found in the southwest and eastern portions of the country. Leopards are found in the eastern border and western region of South Sudan. Leopards are present in southern Chad within the continuous population that crosses Central African Republic. Southeastern Chad, eastern CAR, western South Sudan and possibly also parts of northern DRC form one of the most important Leopard strongholds in Africa.<br/><br/><u><strong>East Africa</strong></u>: The distribution of Leopards in East Africa has been reduced, in particular in Somalia, some parts of Kenya, Ethiopia and central Tanzania. Since last assessment, we have expanded Leopard range in Ethiopia connecting subpopulations from the west and southern border through the central highlands in one continuous population that extends into northern Somalia. This represents the only confirmed remaining range in Somalia with smaller isolated populations possibly extant. There are possible, isolated, remnant populations in Djibouti, Eritrea, and Sudan. Leopards in Kenya have retracted along the central spine of the country with range also extending along the southern border with Tanzania and small isolated populations along the coast though predictive modelling suggests there is potential Leopard occupancy in the eastern portion of the country (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2022). Leopards are found in increasingly isolated populations in Uganda, primarily in the west and Rwanda with small possibly extant populations in Burundi. In Tanzania, Leopards are found throughout the Serengeti-Ngorogoro Crater system and to large parts of southern and western Tanzania. It is thought that Leopards are absent from the southeastern boundary of Lake Victoria to Central Tanzania potentially creating a widening separation between northern and southern populations.<br/><br/><u><strong>Southern Africa</strong>:</u> Southern Africa likely has one of the healthiest Leopard populations of their entire range. It is generally thought that Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique have declining but healthy Leopard populations outside of human dominated areas (C. Begg, A. Loveridge, M. Becker, E. Droge, A. Kusler, E. Rosenblatt and D. Smit pers. comm. 2023). In Angola, Leopard range has likely constricted to the southeastern region and smaller sub populations in the southwest and in Parque Nacional do Bicuar in the south (R. Groom pers. comm. 2023). In Namibia, Leopards range remains relatively stable since the last assessment inhabiting the northern portion of the country except for the highly populated northern region, the arid southeast farmlands and the desert coast (Richmond-Coogan 2019). Botswana has a continuous Leopard population throughout, aside from the large salt pan in the northcentral region. In South Africa, Leopards are found along the boundaries with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique with dense populations located in the Limpopo and Mpumalanga regions. Leopards are also located in the Cape provinces of South Africa (Devens <em>et al</em>. 2018, Müller <em>et al. </em>2022). Since the last assessment, it appears that connectivity between leopard populations in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi (and surrounding private reserves) and the southern portion of the Kruger National Park system has been severed. Leopards are likely extirpated from Lesotho and most of Eswatini aside from the northeast corner.<br/><br/><strong>Leopards in Asia</strong><br/><u><strong>The Arabian Peninsula and the Levant</strong></u>: In Oman, the Arabian Leopard remain in the Dhofar Mounatins of the south in the arid and monsoon habitats of Jabal Al Qamar, Jabal Al Qara and Jabal Samhan (Spalton and Al Hikmani 2014, Al Hikmani et al. 2023). It appears that there are no functional wild Leopard populations in Saudi Arabia (Dunford <em>et al.</em> 2023). Possibly individual Leopards occasionally disperse into Saudi Arabia from Yemen, although the border fence maybe a hindrance (Zafar-ul Islam<em> et al. </em>2021, Al Hikmani <em>et al.</em> 2023). In Yemen the Arabian Leopard possibly still remains in the northern part of the western highlands, the central-western highland and in south Yemen. Itspresence has been confirmed in Hawf close to the Oman border (Mallon and Budd 2011, Al Hikmani <em>et al.</em> 2023). In Israel and Palestine the Leopard is locally extinct as well as in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula (Spalton and Al Hikmani 2006, Jacobson <em>et al. </em>2016, Al Hikmani<em> et al. </em>2023). <br/><br/><u><strong>Middle East and Central Asia with the Caucasus</strong></u>: Leopards have a wide range of distribution across the region though their distribution has decreased to 27% of their historic range (Bleyhl <em>et al. </em>2022). The habitat patches are spread over 11 countries from Türkiye in the West to Pakistan in the East, Russian North Caucasus and Kazakhstan to the North and Iran to the South (Bleyhl <em>et al.</em> 2022). Northern Iran and Central Asia hosts the largest population nucleus across the region, (Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2022), making it one of the largest continuous leopard hotspots across Asia (Jacobson<em> et al.</em> 2016). Almost 80% of the region’s leopards exist in Iran with 38.6% of the total area equal to 204,005 km2, mostly across the Alborz Mountains in the North and the Zagros Mountains in the Southwest (Bleyhl <em>et al</em>. 2022, Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2022, Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2022). The Leopard population in Iran is connected with the populations in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Iraqi Kurdistan, and possibly also to the populations in Türkiye, Afghanistan and Pakistan (Ghoddousi and Khorozyan 2023). However, the transboundary connectivity is not always functional due to border fences, roads and small size of the border populations (Ghoddousi and Khorozyan 2023). Camera trapping surveys in Tandoureh and Golestan National Parks, these two reserves hold the largest populations of Persian leopards in west and central Asia. The Leopard population in Kazakhstan is dependent on transboundary movements (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2019). The first recent occurrence of Persian leopard in Kazakhstan was documented by camera-traps in 2018, but then this individual died in 2021 (Pestov <em>et al</em>. 2019). Opportunistic camera-trapping and observations over the past decade suggest that the Kopetdag and its extension into the Sunt Hasardag in the north and Badhyz in the southeast remains the most important stronghold of the leopard (though in low densities) in Turkmenistan (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2022, T. Rosen, pers. obs., Team Bars Turkmenistan, 2021). The western range of Persian leopard lays along Zagros Mountains spanning between Iran, Iraq and Turkey, but often in smaller populations (Ghoddousi <em>et al. </em>2010, Farhadinia<em> et al</em>. 2021). Recent camera trapping efforts revealed the occurrence of leopards in multiple sites in Iraq and Turkey, many of them without any record prior to 2000s (Horeni <em>et al.</em> 2022, Karataş <em>et al. </em>2021, Ahmed <em>et al.</em> 2023), raising the hopes for the recovery of Persian leopards across its western range. In the Caucasus region, the range of this big cat is confined to the mountain ridges of the Lesser Caucasus, Greater Caucasus, Talysh Mountains and their branches, and is heavily fragmented due to human activities. Leopards occur in the southern part of the Zangezur Ridge and its vicinity shared by Armenia and Azerbaijan’s Nakhchyvan Republic as well as the Talysh Mountains. in southeastern Azerbaijan (Khorozyan <em>et al.</em> 2022), across the entire Kurdistan Region of Iraq, specifically in the Qara Dagh, Khoshk and Bamo Mountains (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2022), in central and eastern parts of Afghanistan, and finally, in the north Indus/Himalayan region of Pakistan (Ostrowski <em>et al.</em> 2022). A continuous monitoring through camera-trapping shows that there are small populations in Armenia and Azerbaijan (Khorozyan<em> et al.</em> 2022, Askerov <em>et al. </em>2019). There are very few individuals recorded in the Turkish and Russian parts of the Caucasus and only one confirmed individual is known from Georgia. Iran has been the main country for leopard survival in the Caucasus containing the largest population in the region (Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2015, Khorozyan<em> et al. </em>2022) with a guesstimate of fewer than 20 leopards (Bleyhl <em>et al. </em>2021). Across its eastern range, the Persian leopards has been recently confirmed only from the central and eastern parts of Afghanistan as well as in lower Himalayan range and southwestern borders of Pakistan. However, there was no confirmed contemporary records (&gt;2000) from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan where nowadays the species is believed to be extinct (Tajikistan) or quasi-extinct (Uzbekistan; Ostrowski <em>et al.</em> 2022).<br/><br/>The distribution in other countries including Afghanistan (Central parts of the Hindu Kush), Türkiye (Iğdir and Artvin provinces), Georgia (the Greater Caucasus), Russian North Caucasus (Dagestan, Kabardino-Balkarian and Chechen Republics as well as the reintroduced individuals in the Caucasus Biosphere Reserve and the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania), Uzbekistan (Babatag, Kugitang and Boysun Mts.) and Kazakhstan (Ustyurt Plateau) is either less poorly understood or not widespread (Ghoddousi and Khorozyan 2023).<br/><br/><strong>South and Central Asia</strong>: There is some indication of its presence in the Babatag and Kugitang mountains of Uzbekistan (N. Marmazinskaya pers. comm. 2014). A confirmed record of Leopard was obtained in Afghanistan in the Bamyan province in 2011 in a camera trap image (Moheb and Bradfield 2014). In Pakistan, Leopards also inhabit broken hilly or mountainous country throughout Waziristan, Baluchistan and Sindh Kohistan in association with acacia scrub forest (Roberts 1997). Using DNA from scats, Leopard presence was confirmed in Ayubia National Park northeast Pakistan (Shehzad <em>et al.</em> 2014). Leopards occur widely in the forests of Bhutan and Nepal. Leopards are widespread across India in subpopulations in different regions including cameratrap confirmations in most tiger reserves (Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2013, Harihar<em> et al.</em> 2009, Shivakumar <em>et al.</em> 2023) and in Sri Lanka (Kittle and Watson 2020) they occur in a mosaic of habitat types including forests and cultivated lands.&#160; <br/><br/><strong>East Asia</strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong>Russian Far East, North East China and Korea</strong>: Historically, leopards inhabited East Manchurian Mountains in eastern parts of Jilin and Liaoning provinces, China, and southern part of Primorsky province, Russia until the Khanka Lake. The northernmost points were registered at N48°50′ on the Lesser Khingan ridge. It was quite common in mountains of Korea peninsula before their decline due to uncontrolled hunting and deforestation during the Japanese occupation and Korean War (1910-1953). During 20th century, the total area of Amur leopard decreased 40 times, and the only population survived in Southwest Primorsky province of Russia and nearby bordering areas of China and North Korea (Pikunov and Korkishko 1992, Shoemaker 1993, Gao<em> et al.</em> 1993, Pikunov<em> et al.</em> 2009, Tian <em>et al.</em> 2009). Due to the huge conservation efforts, the last wild population has been recovered, and in 2015 it’s range increased twice to about 7,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2017, Vitkalova<em> et al.</em> 2018). The area of Leopards in Russian Far East and nearby Northeast China was enlarged during 2015-2019 from 6,800 km<sup>2</sup> to 10,500 km<sup>2</sup> (Y. Darman pers. comm. 2024). By 2021, Leopards occupied all suitable habitats in the Southwest Primorsky province (about 5,380 km<sup>2</sup>), while transient males went 70 km to the North to Pogranichny Ridge and 60 km to the East to Shkotovo Plateau, crossing railroads, highways and belts of agricultural lands (Vitkalova <em>et al.</em> 2023, Y. Darman pers. comm. 2023). Animals from Russia became a source for species recovery in North East China (Jiang <em>et al. </em>2015), where leopards already registered 147 km West from Sino-Russian border (G. Jiang pers. comm.). According to Chinese scientists, 32,750 km2 are potentially suitable for leopards in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, of which 8,625 km<sup>2</sup> are already inhabited by leopards (Jiang<em> et al.</em> 2016). The most important part is the Laoyeling Mountains, which selected as the first priority for leopard and tiger restoration in China (Li <em>et al.</em> 2012, Qi <em>et al.</em> 2021). <br/><u><br/></u><strong>Central China</strong>: the historic range distribution of leopard south-west from Beijing at Chinese Loess Plateau has drastically decreased to small isolated areas in Hebei, Shanxi, Ningxia, northern Shaanxi and northern Henan provinces (Laguardia <em>et al.</em> 2017, Vitekere <em>et al. </em>2021). The most densely populated habitat is found in the Taihang Mountains within the Shanxi Province (Li 2016, Yuli 2018, Zhu <em>et al. </em>2021) and the Ziwuling forest region in Shaanxi Province (Minqi 2018, Yang<em> et al.</em> 2021). The 2018-2020 detail camera-trap survey of 41 protected areas in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces discovered leopards at 141 sites in 17 nature reserve (Fu <em>et al.</em> 2023). Leopards appear to have been extirpated throughout all other provinces in central and eastern China, including Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangxi and Jiangxi (Laguardia <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>South-West China</strong> (western Sichuan, southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet regions): In Sichuan Province the current status of leopards is unclear, and all recent records are from the west, including camera trap images and fresh scats. Camera-trapping studies in ten protected areas in central Sichuan during 2002–2009 failed to record leopards, indicating this species might be extirpated from large areas of the province. In Tibet leopards were recently recorded in the east (S. Li pers. comm.). There are also several recent records of leopards from the east and south-central Tibet, including the forest zone of Mt Everest (Jacobson <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Qinghai Province, data from local interviews suggested leopards occur in the south (D. Wang pers. comm.). Leopards has recently been recorded in camera traps in two nature reserves in south-western Yunnan Province near the border with Myanmar but the population is low (probably &lt; 10 individuals in each reserve) and is unlikely to recover because of the high levels of habitat fragmentation and poaching, and low prey numbers <br/><br/><strong>Southeast Asia</strong>: Leopards have become extirpated or functionally extirpated throughout much of southeast Asia with populations remaining only in Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia and Java, Indonesia. In recent years, Leopards have disappeared from Cambodia, southern China, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (S. Rostro-Garcia pers. comm. 2023). Leopards inhabit forests in Thailand in the Western Forest Complex (WEFCOM; Simcharoen <em> et al. </em>2018) and in the Kaeng Krachan Forest Complex (Pliosungnoen 2022) along the borders with Myanmar. Leopards are still present in Malaysia but are now absent from large portions of the country. Leopards have been confirmed in 22 forest patches on the island of Java, representing only 9% of the landmass of the island with estimates of 319 individuals (Wibisono <em> et al. </em>2018, 2021). Recent surveys and conservation efforts estimate a population of 319 individuals that are more isolated than previously thought (Wibisono <em> et al. </em>2018). Researchers emphasize connectivity between priority landscapes that are predicted as important extension for subpopulations (Wibisono<em> et al</em>. 2021).","Leopards are targeted for trophy hunting and are illegally hunted for wildlife trade for their skins (used in traditional ceremonies), and bones and other parts (used for medicinal purposes in eastern cultures and for spiritual and cultural beliefs in West and Central Africa.",Terrestrial,"The Leopard is included in CITES Appendix I. Trade of Leopard skins and derivative products is restricted to 2,648 individuals in 12 countries (with Kenya and Malawi abstaining from using from hunting leopard) in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, the practices within the hunting industry have been called into question by wildlife researchers and conservationists (Packer <em>et al. </em>2011). In 2010, the government of Namibia conducted an assessment of trophy hunting in response to calls for an increase in permits amid reports of unethical hunting practices. Zambia placed a moratorium on Leopard and Lion hunting in 2013 due to concerns about the conservation status of the populations. In South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana, researchers have developed regional studies of the hunting quota systems that incorporate measures of trophy quality and regulate the distribution of permits. These quota studies integrate previous hunting data to prescribe the number and distribution of hunting permits with local stakeholder participation. In Botswana, a moratorium on Leopard hunting was implemented from 2014 to 2022 when a quota was released (DWNP 2021). South Africa suspended trophy hunting of Leopards for the year in 2016.<br/><br/>Regulating trophy hunting will only address a percentage of Leopard mortality; human-Leopard conflict within livestock and game farming communities is likely the greatest source, particularly in southern Africa. In many countries of southern and East Africa, farmers are allowed to kill predators that are considered a threat to life and property with permits distributed retroactively. It is likely that a high percentage of Leopards are killed without reporting and therefore the exact numbers of Leopards killed through actual or perceived conflict is unknown. Generally, efforts to calculate mortality through human-wildlife conflict have been considered unreliable. Since the majority of Leopard range is outside of protected areas, conflict mitigation strategies such as livestock husbandry, compensation/ insurance programmes, alterations in trophy hunting permit distribution and public awareness have all been used to assist farmers and increasing tolerance for living with leopards (Balme&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009b, Stein&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010). Where conflict Leopards have been identified, translocation has been tried often with negative results (Weilenmann <em>et al.</em> 2010, Athreya <em>et al. </em>2011), however, effective translocation criteria have been developed based on suitable release site characteristics (Weise&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015). Namibia and Botswana have promoted wildlife conservation through the devolution of wildlife management and the establishment of benefit sharing initiatives between photographic tour operators, professional hunters and communities through Conservancies and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs; Jones 1993). These initiatives were modelled after previous efforts such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>In North and West Africa, the Middle East and large parts of Asia, Leopards are largely restricted to protected areas where they are afforded refuge if poaching is not significant. However, many of these protected areas are not large enough to maintain genetically viable populations and will likely require intensive management. As positive example, the creation of large national parks on the Sino-Russian border played crucial role in restoration of Amur leopard population (Vitkalova&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2023). In Indo-Malayasia and China, Leopards require increased protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007). <br/><br/>Since the previous status update, researchers have undertaken population surveys within protected areas throughout Leopard range. These surveys have improved our understanding of Leopard status with greater resolution and in some cases generated population estimates. We recommend increased population surveys for Leopards, in particular across Central Africa, Angola, South-east Asia and South-west China.<br/><br/>To address the use of Leopard skins for traditional ceremonies, conservationists in South Africa have partnered with textile companies and communities to provide faux-fur alternatives (Naude&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>International collaborative efforts to facilitate cross- boundary protections and potential connectivity have been underway developing among researchers and country leadership for the Persian Leopard (Bleyhl&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022). Currently, only around 11% of the core habitat patches of the Persian Leopard fall within protected areas across its entire range (Bleyhl <em>et al.</em> 2022). The collaboration between Russia and China creates possibility to launch in 2024 the Sino-Russian transboundary nature reserve, covering 90% of Amur leopard current range (Y. Darman, pers. comm. 2024). Leopard population recovery efforts are currently underway with reintroduction projects in the Greater Caucasus (Rozhnov&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2022), the Russian Far East (Y. Darman, pers. comm. 2023) and Africa (McManus <em>et al. </em>2022, Power <em>et al.</em> 2021). Researchers are exploring efforts to reintroduce the Arabian Leopard from local captive facilities (Budd and Leus 2013).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,False,False,Global

High levels of threat are expected on the African continent since human  populations in many Cheetah range states are predicted to double over the next few decades, with leading to increased pressures on natural resources (United Nations 2017). Preventing a steep decline in Cheetah populations in the face of an ongoing period of rapid growth in Africa’s human population over the next few decades will be the most serious  challenge for the conservation of this species.<br/><br/>Given the  evidence of ongoing and increasing threats to Cheetah posed by rapid anthropogenic change across the species range, we recommend that the Cheetah is a species under observation and its threat status is closely monitored, with a reassessment after a minimum three-year period or as soon as new information emerges.","In Africa, Cheetah are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions,  ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and  hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, 2012, 2015;  Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2017). They are only absent from tropical and  montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of  4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat  consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than  100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from  plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that  rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em> 2018), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli <em>et al.</em>  2009). Cheetah were reported as relatively rare across the large belt  of miombo woodlands in southern Tanzania and northern Mozambique (Myers  1975), and have not been recorded in these habitats in recent years  (IUCN 2007a; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). However, a recent study has indicated that miombo woodlands may be important habitat for Cheetah (Strampelli <em>et al.</em> 2021), raising questions about the value of miombo habitats for Cheetah.<br/><br/>Cheetah  are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching  speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second; Sharp 1997).  However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down  because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual  speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013a, b).  Cheetah make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are  unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of  meters. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to  mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle (<em>Gazella </em>spp.), kob (<em>Kobus kob</em>)  and impala (<em>Aepyceros melampus</em>). But their prey can range from  ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large  ungulates such as wildebeest (<em>Connochates taurinus</em>), kudu (<em>Tragelaphus  strepciseros</em>) or eland (<em>Tragelaphus oryx</em>) (Purchase and du Toit 2000,  Broomhall <em>et al.</em> 2003, Mills <em>et al.</em> 2004, Cooper <em>et al.</em> 2007, Hilborn <em>et al.</em>  2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of  scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Ibex  <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species  (Khalatbari 2021, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012). Earlier studies using  scat suggested that livestock formed an important component of the diet  of Asiatic cheetah (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012), however recent genetic analysis found very little evidence of livestock consumption (Khalatbari 2021).<br/><br/>Cheetah,  unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with  high densities of large carnivore competitors, Cheetah can lose up to  around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and  spotted hyaenas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007b), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter <em>et al.</em>  2007c). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a  strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some  evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis  <em>et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use  visual cues to avoid competitors may be a key driver of diurnal  behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such  as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as  being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower  number of competitors or higher human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetah have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant <em>et al.</em>  2007, 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young,  and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or  three (Caro 1994, Broomhall <em>et al.</em> 2003, Marnewick <em>et al.</em>  2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also  be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions  formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard  and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetah appear to mate  with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In  areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female  Cheetah, and males without territories, follow the herds, with average  home ranges of 800 km², while territorial males may hold small territories (average 30 km²) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant <em>et al.</em>1988,  Caro 1994). A similar pattern whereby territorial males have smaller  territories than non-territorial males has since been observed on  Namibian farmlands, where male territories averaged 379 km²&#160;compared with home ranges of non-territorial males of 1,595 km² (Melzheimer <em>et al.</em>2018). The same study estimated female Cheetah home ranges to average 650 km²&#160;(n=17). Another study on Namibian farmlands found both Cheetah sexes to have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km²);  however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home  range. A study of a small number of individuals in Kruger National Park  found male and female home ranges to be more similar in size, although  more data are required to know whether these data are representative  (Broomhall <em>et al.</em> 2003). It has been hypothesized that the  Cheetah’s unusual social system and ranging patterns originally evolved  as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger  competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a  spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a,b). This is  supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by Cheetah in Botswana  and South Africa (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In  the wild, Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and  five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have  not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em>  2010b). Cheetah give birth to their first litter at two years after a  three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the  first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to  hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub  mortality can be high. In the Serengeti, 95% of cubs died before  independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most  of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were  able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson <em>et al.</em>  1992). Elsewhere, cub mortality is reported to be lower, although  information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely  available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth  to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the  Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation  (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key  predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey  Badgers, Jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role (Laurenson 1994,  Mills and Mills 2014).<br/><br/>If Cheetah cubs survive, they will stay  with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will  roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). After  which, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their  first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single  males may also meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition  (Caro 1994). In the Serengeti, mean annual mortality for females and  males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1–2-year-olds; and 0.15 and 0.31  for adults (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult  mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of  juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large  predators (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003c, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). It is  difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti  adult Cheetah have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and  one individual died from encephalitis (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b).  Male Cheetah may be killed by other males, probably during territorial  disputes (Caro 1994). More recently, several Cheetah have also been  killed on the main road passing through the Serengeti (see Threats section). <br/><br/>In  comparison with other big cats, Cheetah occur at relatively low  densities (10–30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and  Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant <em>et al.</em>2007). The highest density  recorded for Cheetah, not including small and intensively managed  fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park,  where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km²&#160;(Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011), but Cheetah can congregate seasonally at high densities (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 1988, Melzheimer <em>et al.</em>2020),  which can give a misleading impression of overall density. Caro (1994)  attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich  Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species  such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on  Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors,  Cheetah still occur at low densities of 0.25 per 100 km²&#160;(Marker 2002) and 0.025 per 100 km²&#160;(Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015), respectively. In such environments, Cheetah may be limited by  prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside  other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize  the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant  1998, 2000a,c; Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<p></p>","As a wide-ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km², Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a,b, 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much  larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore  species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures  which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC  2007a, b, 2012; Durant 2017).<br/><br/>The majority of Cheetah resident range (77%) and most of the Cheetah population (67%) are found on unprotected land (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013, Dickman <em>et al.</em>  2014). While Cheetah tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may  kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers either  in retaliation to depredation or to prevent livestock loss (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman <em>et al.</em>  2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetah are seen as  competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both  subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah  survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that  they can be difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em>  2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other  carnivores such as Hyaena species, Leopards and Lions. There are likely  to be complex underlying issues that can significantly exacerbate  conflict, including, for example, a history of grievance against  government or the establishment of protected areas and external economic  or political processes that have reconfigured human-carnivore relations  (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2022). The multiple threats faced by Cheetah on  unprotected lands, combined with evidence of widespread population  declines, has resulted in the species being termed ‘protection reliant’  (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock  densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion will directly  impact Cheetah population size. The industrial levels of bushmeat  extraction occurring across many areas where Cheetah still occur  (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013, Ripple <em>et al.</em> 2016) has a serious  impact on Cheetah population viability. Prey loss can also have serious  indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent  where wild prey is depleted (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying  conflict with livestock farmers. Cheetah may also become captured in  snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary  target (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013). While these bycatch effects on  Cheetah populations are not well quantified, there are multiple  unpublished observations of snared Cheetah (see also Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2009) and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High  speed roads also represent a growing threat to Cheetah subpopulations.  This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major  wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo  National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khar  Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah  mortalities between 2001 and 2016 due to various human-causes, at least  14 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Touran, Bafq and Dareh Anjir  protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality  (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013, CACP unpublished data). Between 2014 and  2019 six adult Cheetah were hit and killed by cars on the dirt main road  through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (S. M. Durant and D.  Minja, pers. obs.). Additional deaths have also been reported on many  other roads, including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such  mortality could have a significant impact on population viability,  particularly when populations are small and/or isolated.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe <em>et al.</em>  1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists  from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12–15% of  their total time spent for wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe <em>et al.</em>  1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist  behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference  with Cheetah hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are  unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975,  1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother  has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. There  have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah  cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close-up photographs.  In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to  Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by  raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease, notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro <em>et al.</em> 1987, Gakuya <em>et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull <em>et al.</em>  2004), the low density of Cheetah makes it unlikely that infectious  disease presents a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah  are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses.  Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs as  pets to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is  the increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure  development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These  developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah  subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations, which may no  longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in  Iran, especially for the southern subpopulation (Dehghan 2013), but it  is a growing problem in Africa as well.<br/><br/>Climate change will  probably negatively influence Cheetah across their range, including due  to changing patterns of agricultural land conversion. The reduction in  land due to rising sea level, large scale movements of human populations  and increased variability in rainfall will exacerbate negative impacts  of a rapidly rising human population. In Iran, where impacts have been  modelled, it is predicted that climate change will force Cheetah to  shift to more temperate areas where they might face higher levels of  conflict with local people and other large carnivores (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em> in 2018).<br/><br/>All  the threats identified above play some role in most Cheetah  subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa,  habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat  (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, 2015). Because Cheetah occur at low densities,  conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management  planning, including maintaining connectivity; as most existing  protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long-term survival of  Cheetah (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). In the desert habitats of northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Eslami <em>et al.</em> 2017, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015). Conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation,  either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across  most Cheetah range (IUCN SSC 2015, Dickman et al 2018).<br/><br/>While the  threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah  decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include  political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity  and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to  support Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetah  occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support  conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to  conserve wildlife. Meanwhile, a lack of environmental awareness, rising  human populations, and social changes are leading to ever-increasing  subdivision of land, land use change and subsequent habitat  fragmentation. These underlying drivers must be addressed if the  immediate threats are to be reduced. Conserving viable subpopulations of  Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>.  Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified  landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that  Cheetah require may be protected, unprotected, or a combination. Cheetah  also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely  to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and  to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving  connecting habitat (Ahmadi <em>et al.</em> 2017). Cheetah survival, ultimately, will depend on political will to combat existing threats and local community support.","In a recent global assessment by Durant <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2017), the known  remaining Cheetah populations were estimated to be confined to 9% of  their historical distributional range. These authors estimated the  Cheetah population at around 6,517 mature individuals (7,100 adult and  adolescent animals) distributed over 3,100,000 km².  A recent independent study by Weise <em>et al.</em>  (2017), using an extensive database of georeferenced sightings,  estimated the Cheetah population within the southern African countries  of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia and Botswana, at 3,577 adults and  adolescents (Weise <em>et al.</em> 2017), compared with 4,032 estimated for the same countries by Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017). <br/><br/>The population estimates presented here are derived from Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017) and Weise <em>et al.</em>  (2017), except where stated. These estimates are based on expert  information from in-depth surveys and monitoring wherever possible. This  was particularly the case for the estimates in southern Africa (IUCN  SSC 2007a,b, 2012, 2015; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). Where expert-based  information was not available, population estimates were extrapolated  by applying density estimates from comparable areas with known density  to polygons of resident range as mapped during conservation strategy  workshops (see #s 1 to 4) below). Density estimates were conservative,  since sites where abundance is unknown may face higher pressures than  sites where there is better information on abundance (Durant <em>et al.</em>  2017). Density estimates in both studies refer to adults and  independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs. Four density  estimates were used (below) and resulting figures were then adjusted to  represent only the number of mature individuals in the population:<br/><p></p><ol><li>Well-managed, relatively productive, protected areas (PAs). Density was estimated at one individual per 100 km², which falls on the low end of the range for highly productive, well managed PAs (1.3–2.5 per 100 km², Broekhuis and Gopalaswamy 2016, Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2014, Durant <em>et al.</em>  2011). We picked this figure as the referenced estimates appear  atypically high, and come from some of the most productive and best  managed protected areas in Africa (the Serengeti Mara ecosystem and  Kruger National Park). It is unlikely that any other protected areas can  achieve densities even at the low end of this range, either because  they are less well managed, or because they are less productive.</li><li>Areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat. Density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km², corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (range 0.25 to 0.83 per 100 km²; Marker 2002);</li><li>The Sahara. Density was estimated at 0.025 individuals per 100 km², using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015).</li><li>Two  subpopulations in West and Central Africa which do not align to  categories 1–3. Density was estimated at 0.1 individual per 100 km²,  consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but  lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with the elevated  pressures and direct threats in these regions due to high rates of  habitat encroachment and illegal activities.</li></ol>The population estimates  so derived for Cheetah presented here, including the expert based  estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an  indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are  imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in  a large overall change in population estimates. Thus, the estimates are  extremely tentative and comparisons with previous estimates (which were  also very tentative and based on even weaker data) are unreliable.  Nonetheless, these recent studies provide the best available information  at the global level.<br/><br/>Number of mature individuals in the  population was calculated using estimates from the long-term study of  individually known cheetahs in the Serengeti (Durant <em>et al.</em>  2004). Using a stable age structure model, and assuming 1) half of all  1–2 year olds in a population are independent at 18–24 months; and 2)  that there is a 2:1 ratio of adult females to males, we calculate that  8.2% of a population estimate of independent Cheetahs (adults and  adolescents) constitutes individuals of 18–24 months. We thus use the  equation MI = N - (N*0.082), to calculate the number of mature  individuals older than two years (MI) where N is the estimated number of  adults and adolescents. <br/><br/><strong>Southern Africa<br/></strong>Southern  Africa is a global stronghold for Cheetah, holding a tentative estimate  of  3,526 mature individuals distributed across at least 11  subpopulations (from Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017, Weise <em>et al.</em>  2017). A large centre of distribution comprises the majority of the  regional population, <em>ca</em> 3,396 mature individuals, distributed across a  large transboundary landscape covering southern Botswana, Namibia,  southern Angola, northern South Africa and south-western Mozambique. The  remaining subpopulations in the southern Africa region are much  smaller: 60 mature individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 46 in and  around Hwange National Park; 42 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save  Conservancy; 37 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe;  18 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 11 in the Zambezi valley; nine in Banhine  National Park, Mozambique; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe; 24 in the  Moxico region in central Angola; and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe  (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). The latter subpopulation has decreased  substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid-1990s and may  indicate poor long-term viability of isolated Cheetah populations in  small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase <em>et al.</em>  2006). A large proportion (75%) of the estimated resident range in the  region is outside protected areas, on lands ranched primarily for  livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2015, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas (<em>Crocuta crocuta</em>), have been extirpated from much of this range.<br/><br/>For  the purposes of this assessment, Cheetah populations are considered to  be ‘wild’ when they are not intensively managed, in line with the  guidelines of IUCN SSC (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2019;  see also Redford <em>et al</em>.&#160;2011). Intensive management of Cheetah  (such as frequent translocation of individuals for genetic management)  is necessary in reserves smaller than 1,000 km²&#160;that are  surrounded by impermeable fencing. There are around 330 Cheetah in an  intensively managed free-ranging meta-population distributed across  small fenced reserves in South Africa (Buk <em>et al.</em> 2018) and, more  recently, in Liwonde National Park in Malawi (Dasgupta 2017). These  Cheetah have been excluded from the overall population estimates in line  with the IUCN SSC guidelines. However, when such populations are well  managed, such as the South African Cheetah meta-population, in ways that  allow a wide range of natural behaviours of Cheetah, including hunting,  such populations can make a valuable contribution to ‘wild’ populations  by providing individuals for well-planned restorations.<br/><strong><br/>Eastern Africa</strong><br/>The  Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,102 mature  individuals distributed across 14 subpopulations (from Durant <em>et al.</em>  2017). Only one of these subpopulations is estimated to number more  than 200 mature individuals. In descending order of estimated population  size the 15 subpopulations are: 1,250 mature individuals in the  Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo/Laikipia landscape in Kenya and northern Tanzania;  184 in the Ruaha landscape in central Tanzania; 175 in a transboundary  population through southern Ethiopia, eastern South Sudan and northern  Kenya; 135 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 78 in Badingilo  National Park in South Sudan; 62 in Radom National Park in South Sudan;  55 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 47 in the Maasai steppe  in Tanzania; 33 in South Turkana in Kenya; 29 in the Ogaden landscape in  Ethiopia; 18 in Blen-Afar Landscape in Ethiopia; 17 in the Kidepo  National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan; 10 in the  Afar landscape in Ethiopia; and seven in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in  Ethiopia (recalculated from Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). A substantial  proportion (75.4%) of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside  protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional  pastoralist communities (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017), where cheetah face  elevated threats from retaliatory killings; unsustainable rangeland  management leading to a loss of prey; and minimal protection against  other illegal killings (e.g. for trade).<br/><br/><strong>Western, Central and Northern Africa</strong><br/>The  number of Cheetah in western, central and northern Africa is  tentatively estimated at 419 mature individuals distributed across four  populations (from Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). These are: 218 mature  individuals in Bahr/Salama landscape in Chad and CAR; 175 in the Adrar  des Ifhogas / Ahaggar / Tassili N’Ajjer landscape in Algeria and Mali;  23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; two in Air et  Ténéré connected to another 1–2 mature individuals in the Termit Massif,  both in Niger. As in the other regions, the majority of the population  (83%) is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by  traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC  2012, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Many of these areas face  unsustainable killing of wild ungulates, particularly close to  settlements, and unsustainable management of the desert landscapes,  alongside a risk of illegal killing of Cheetahs.<br/><strong><br/>Asia</strong><br/>In  Asia, Cheetah are now confined to Iran, and comprise the subspecies <em>A.  j. venaticus</em>. A recent comprehensive review of available information on  Cheetah in Iran has raised concerns of a dangerous ongoing decline in  Cheetah numbers, (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2017) which confirms that the population size is estimated to be less than 50 mature individuals (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em>  2017). The imprisonment in January 2018 of key individuals who have  been most active in improving the conservation outlook for Asiatic  Cheetah, and the lack of conservation activity since, diminishes hopes  of any recovery of this population (Long 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Global population</strong><br/>The  total known Cheetah population is therefore tentatively estimated at  around 6,517 mature individuals. However, with home ranges documented in  excess of 3,000 km²&#160;(Marker <em>et al.</em> 2008, Weise <em>et al.</em> 2015), movements of translocated animals exceeding 1,000 km (Weise <em>et al.</em>2015) and densities seldom exceeding two per 100 km²,  the combination of wide-ranging behaviour and low densities make the  estimation of Cheetah population size (and hence threat status)  extremely challenging. Moreover, all existing estimates of density and  abundance come from either protected areas (e.g. Kruger National Park,  Moremi Game Reserve, Serengeti National Park), or from areas where there  are active Cheetah conservation organizations working across large  areas (e.g. the Namibian farmlands that are the focus of the Cheetah  Conservation Fund). Few of these estimates provide the time series data  needed to estimate population trends. There are also few reliable  estimates of density or abundance from sites where Cheetah populations  are most threatened and likely to be in steep decline (the exception  being a repeated country-wide survey of the cheetah population in  Zimbabwe; van der Meer 2016). As such, quantitative estimates of  population trends are largely unknown; however, of 18 populations where  trends could be assigned, 14 were assessed to be in decline, three were  stable, and only one could have been increasing (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The  combination of large home range, low density and biased data (from  areas where Cheetah are least threatened), poses a serious challenge to  the assessment of threat for this species. This challenge is further  exacerbated by the finding that the majority of known Cheetah range  (77%) and Cheetah population (67%) are on unprotected lands. Here  Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to multiple threats, including  increased pressures from habitat loss and fragmentation; widespread  human-wildlife conflict; prey loss resulting from overhunting and  bushmeat harvesting and illegal trade (IUCN/SSC 2007a, 2012, 2015). Even  within PAs, because of edge effects and poor law enforcement, Cheetah  remain highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures. In these landscapes  Cheetah live alongside some of the most marginalized and vulnerable  people in the world.<br/><br/>These rural human communities, already under  pressure, are expected to grow rapidly over the next three decades  (United Nations 2017, Gerland <em>et al.</em> 2014), which will place  unprecedented pressures on habitats, wildlife and ecosystems. A recent  assessment has documented extinction of Cheetah from 11 out of 15  protected areas (PAs) in West and Central Africa (73% of site  extinction) (Brugiere <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Zimbabwe, Cheetah  populations have collapsed by 85% and the species has disappeared from  63% of its distributional range over the last 10–15 years (van der Meer  2018). Moreover, Cheetah have been extirpated from much of Mozambique,  Zambia, Tanzania, Zambia, Sudan, Somalia and Angola (IUCN SSC 2007a, 2015), most probably over just the last few decades. It is likely that  Cheetah populations in many countries are facing similar steep declines  due to rapid land use change and rising intolerance of Cheetah outside  PAs (van der Meer 2018), as well as a massive bushmeat trade, which has  removed prey from large tracts of Cheetah range (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013). This wider context is key to the interpretation of a recent in-depth examination of Cheetah status by Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017).   <br/><br/>The  global population of Cheetah is highly fragmented. Of the 33  populations that still survive, only two have an estimated size of more  than 1,000 mature individuals (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). The analysis by Weise <em>et al.</em>  (2017) suggests that the largest population of Cheetah in southern  Africa is likely to be more fragmented than that depicted in Durant <em>et al.</em>  (2017). Furthermore, two thirds of populations comprise fewer than 100  mature individuals and, even more worryingly, six populations do not  even reach double digits. It is likely that, without urgent conservation  intervention, many of the smaller populations will go extinct over the  next 1–2 decades.<br/><br/><strong>Previous IUCN threat assessments and problems with trend estimation:</strong><br/>The  lack of reliable data on population trends for Cheetah, particularly in  past IUCN Red List threat assessments, has led to the use of  distributional range as an index of population size. However, because  Cheetahs are wide-ranging, distributional range estimates are likely to  be weakly correlated with population abundance. This is because an area  may appear to be widely occupied by Cheetah through reliable  observations, yet the density could be extremely low (Belbachir <em>et al.</em>2015). For example, if well protected and productive, an area of 10,000 km²&#160;could support up to 250 individual Cheetah, whereas, if the area is  unproductive and/or subject to high levels of anthropogenic pressures,  it is likely to hold only 4–20 individuals (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015, Weise <em>et al.</em>  2018). This problem is further compounded by the fact that current  distributional range is delimited using observational records collected  over the previous decade; thus older data may mask recent rapid  declines.<br/><br/>The problems inherent in the data available on  population size and trends for Cheetah, particularly with respect to  historic information, means that comparisons of current estimates with  previous estimates to infer population trends are unreliable. In the  2015 IUCN Red List assessment, estimates of past distributional range  reduction were 29% over the past 15 years, assuming a constant rate of  contraction over the last 100 years. This range collapse, when projected  forwards, predicted a further reduction of 28% over the next 15 years  (stated as more than 10% in the assessment text). However, it is likely  that the observed range collapse has accelerated through time, with the  steepest collapse occurring most recently. Durant <em>et al.</em> (2017)  simulated the global Cheetah population by setting the initial  population equal to a rounded estimated population of 7,000 individuals,  of which 33% occurs in PAs. Populations were simulated over time under a  range of scenarios with growth rates less than replacement outside PAs;  with varying rates of movement inside and outside PAs; and with  populations stable within PAs (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chauvenet <em>et al.</em>  2011). There is a projected decline of a past and inferred decline  tentatively estimated at 21–51% between 2008 to 2023 (three  generations); a past and inferred decline of 14-38% between 2008 to 2018  (two generations) and a past decline of 8–21% between 2008 to 2013 (one  generation; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). Moreover, simulations showed  that declines of more than 50% were likely over the next three Cheetah  generations or 15 years (generation data from Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004)  if the growth rate was 10% less than replacement outside PAs. Such a  decline in global population size raises concerns that the Cheetah  population could meet the IUCN Red List Category of Endangered under  Criterion A3b [a population size reduction of &gt;=50% projected or  suspected to be met within the next three generations based on an index  of abundance]. Sensitivity analysis showed that growth rates within PAs  needed to be 8% or higher to counteract such a decline. Whilst higher  growth rates are theoretically possible; in practice, Cheetah within PAs  suffer from high levels of predation from other, larger, predators such  as lions and spotted hyenas (Laurenson <em>et al.</em> 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em>  2004). Such predation, combined with limitations imposed by prey  availability, prevents high growth rates. In the Serengeti National Park  female Cheetahs are only just able to replace themselves (Laurenson  1995, Chauvenet <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>The results from simulated  projections of the global Cheetah population are consistent with  regional evidence of recent steep population decline. In Zimbabwe,  Cheetah distributional range contracted by 11% per year between 2007 and  2015, while the population has collapsed by 85% over a similar period,  from an estimated minimum of 1,520 cheetahs in 1999 to only 150–170  Cheetahs in 2015 (IUCN/SSC 2007b, 2015, van der Meer 2018). Almost all  this loss has occurred outside of protected areas (van der Meer 2018).<br/><br/>While  Zimbabwe has been subject to recent rapid land use change from  wildlife-based land use to agricultural use, which is likely responsible  for the steep decline in Cheetah, rapid declines leading to extirpation  across large areas have also been observed in western Africa (Brugiere <em>et al.</em>  2015). Elsewhere in Africa, predicted rapid growth in human populations  (United Nations 2017) and associated pressures on natural resources  means that similar patterns of Cheetah population collapse are likely to  be repeated across many countries over the coming decades. Durant <em>et al.</em>  (2017) used their analysis to develop a decision tree to help  categorise ‘protection reliant’ species such as Cheetah, that are  dependent on active conservation for their survival, but which have  substantial distributional range outside PAs where they are vulnerable  to rapid anthropogenic change.",Decreasing,"<p>Historically widespread across Africa and southwestern Asia, Cheetah are  now known to occur in only 9% of their past distributional range, with  their remaining strongholds in Southern and Eastern Africa (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017).  <br/><br/>In Eastern Africa Cheetah are known to occur in only 11% of their historical range (615,000 km²; Durant <em>et al.</em>  2017), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (IUCN/SSC 2007a).  Significant Cheetah range occurs in the transboundary areas between  northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. Almost the entire southern  boundary of Ethiopia is recorded as resident Cheetah range with  connectivity into South Sudan and this population likely extends into  northern Kenya. Important subpopulations of Cheetah survive elsewhere in  Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, as well as in South Sudan and northern  Uganda but are notably fragmented across the region. Their status in  Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern  Africa Cheetah are known to occur in 22% of their historical range  (1,325,000 km²), and possibly occur in another 424,000 km² (IUCN/SSC  2015). Most of the Cheetah surviving in this region are in a single  transboundary population stretching across Namibia, Botswana, southern  Angola, northern South Africa, south-western Mozambique and southern  Zambia. Small isolated populations (&lt;100 mature individuals) also  survive elsewhere in central Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique  (IUCN/SSC 2015, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2015, Weise <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Cheetah have declined particularly precipitously across western, central and northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017, Brugiere <em>et al.</em>  2015). The subspecies found in northwest Africa is <em>A. j. hecki</em>. Across this region, Cheetah now occur in  9% of their historical range (1,037,000 km²), and possibly occur in  another 921,000 km². However, much of this range is within the Sahara,  where Cheetah occur at very low densities, estimated as 0.023  individuals per 100 km² (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). There are five known Cheetah subpopulations in this region (IUCN/SSC 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017): south-central Algeria, stretching through to north-eastern Mali, and possibly into western Libya (Belbachir <em>et al.</em>  2015); two tiny connected subpopulations around the Termit massif in  Niger; the WAP complex of protected areas in northern Benin,  south-eastern Burkina Faso and south-western Niger; and south-eastern  Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic (CAR). Cheetah have been  extirpated from their historical range in Western Sahara, Senegal,  Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, DRC and  Ghana (Brugiere <em>et al.</em> 2015, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017). The last reliable Cheetah sighting in Cameroon was in the 1970s (de Iongh <em>et al.</em>  2011), and no tracks were found in an extensive search of the Benoue  Complex in 2007 and 2010, which was their last refuge in the country  (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent extensive surveys for Lion (<em>Panthera  leo</em>) in the best protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the  Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria found no  evidence of Cheetah (Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2014a, b). It is also  unlikely any Cheetah survive in Egypt. Reports from hunters suggest that  Cheetah may persist in south-western Libya (IUCN SSC 2012), but the  status of Cheetah from much of southern Libya, northern Niger, Chad and  CAR remains unknown.<br/><br/>In Asia, the Cheetah has been extirpated  from nearly all of its range. Its historic range extended from the  shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula, north to the  northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through  Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India  (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Habibi 2004, Mallon 2007). Persistence in  Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001). Habibi (2004) considers it extinct  in Afghanistan, although a Cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a  marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2006 (Manati and Nogge 2008). One  reason for the extirpation of Cheetah across most of their Asian range  is thought to have been the live capture of Cheetah, which were then  trained to hunt deer and gazelle as sport for the aristocracy  (Divyabhanusingh 1995). Other key causes of the disappearance of Cheetah  from the region are likely to have been depletion of wild prey,  especially gazelles, the direct killing of Cheetah, and anthropogenic  change and fragmentation of their habitat (Mallon 2007). The Asiatic  Cheetah (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it  is Critically Endangered (Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2017). Even here,  the subspecies now occurs across only 36% of its historical range  (37,000 km²) within Iran with a predicted further loss of 22% (8,000  km²) of their current habitat, mainly due to declines in prey population  and climate change (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em> 2018). The Asiatic cheetah  population is considered to be divided into three subpopulations: in  north-eastern Iran, in central Iran and in Kavir National Park  (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","Illegal trade poses a historical and ongoing threat to Cheetah. Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally into the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah were identified as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia, and global concerns about a resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been recently addressed at CITES (CITES 2013, Mitchell<em> et al. </em>2017). CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). From 2002 to 2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Documentation for illegal trade is more problematic.<br/><br/>Official records show an average of three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetah reported to CITES per year between 2002–2011 (Nowell 2014), and 13 live Cheetahs over three years between 2015-2018 (CITES 2019), however, this is a substantial underestimate of the real trade. Ongoing territorial disputes between Somalia and Somaliland mean that Somalia does not include records of confiscations in Somaliland (where most confiscations occur) in its official records. A comprehensive study utilizing multiple sources found evidence of 1,884 incidents of trade over the decade between 2010-2019 (Tricorache <em>et al.</em> 2021). These incidents were estimated to have involved at least 4,184 cheetahs. This represents nearly 200 incidents per year involving over 400 animals. The majority of individuals traded were traded live (87%), with most of the remaining trade was skins. Trade was detected in 15 cheetah-range states, with the greatest number of traded cheetah recorded in Somalia (42%), Kenya (13%) and Ethiopia (10%). Trade was also detected in 41 non cheetah range states, i.e. transit or destination countries, with the majority in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia (61%), Kuwait (14%) and UAE (14%). These records indicate an illegal trade that is significantly higher than the official reports submitted to CITES, and suggest a recent rise in confiscations.&#160;<p></p>These reports indicate that the Cheetah trade is dominated by a live trade from the Horn of Africa and surrounding regions into the Gulf States. The primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia, and it is likely that many captured cheetah cubs die undetected. Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetah (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetah are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetah in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser<em> et al.</em> 2014). These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports, however the proliferation of photographs of pet cheetah on social media in these countries, demonstrate that many animals are successfully smuggled into these countries.<p>Because of its proximity to the destination markets in the Gulf States, the Horn of Africa and neighbouring areas is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetah is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Countries in this region have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans, and continue to try and address the issue through CITES (e.g. CITES 2013, 2019). Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond (N. Mitchell, pers. obs.). The Cheetah populations that are the likely source for the live trade are increasingly small and isolated, making them extremely vulnerable to any trade.<br/></p><p></p><p>The currently known cheetah populations in the Horn of Africa, close to the Somali border, are likely to suffer the strongest impacts of the illegal trade in live animals. These include the Ethiopian populations in Afar (estimated 11 individuals); Blen-Afar (20 individuals); Ogaden (32 individuals); and Yangudi Rassa (8 individuals), all of which are highly vulnerable to the impacts of even the smallest trade. The border population with Kenya and South Sudan is slightly higher, with an estimated 191 individuals, but still remains extremely vulnerable to even low levels of trade. The section of the Kenyan and Tanzanian population closest to the Somali border is also at high risk. Populations in south Turkana in Kenya (36 individuals); Kidepo in Uganda through to southern South Sudan and northwestern Kenya&#160; (19 individuals); and the South Sudan populations in Badingilo National Park (85 individuals); Radom National Park (68 individuals); and Southern National Park (147 individuals) are also vulnerable, especially as Cheetahs become increasingly scarce in areas closest to the smuggling routes through Somalia. In total, less than 300 Cheetahs are estimated to remain in the Horn of Africa and its borderlands, with a further 355 Cheetah in South Sudan and northern Kenya likely to become increasingly vulnerable to this trade as populations closest to the destination countries become extirpated.</p><p>Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside Leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.</p><p>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetah (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun <em>et al</em>  2013), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetah. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetah between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.</p>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2008, Anon 2017), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live Cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation. The Department of Environment (DoE) in Iran has recently increased fines for capturing or killing Cheetah to 25.000 $.",Terrestrial,"The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require  conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial  conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning  across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human  wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a,b, 2012, 2015; Durant <em>et al.</em>  2022). Most Cheetah range (77%) is on unprotected lands where their  habitat is vulnerable and where they are often persecuted in retaliation  for livestock or game depredation (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The  species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is  protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and  some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b,  2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetah to be killed in  defense of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control  regulations (Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). There is very rarely any  systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way.  Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as  skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional  incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range  states are actively involved with the African Range-Wide Cheetah  Conservation Initiative (CCI) (previously known as the Range Wide  Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs or RWCP), which  has supported them in the participatory development of regional  strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC  strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are  combined in the conservation planning process because of their similar  low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also  increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts  for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three  regional strategies in place for Africa covering all Cheetah range:  Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2015); and  Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012). The Southern  Africa strategy was developed from a review of the initial strategy  developed in 2007 (IUCN SSC 2007b). A similar review of the Eastern  Africa strategy has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is  planned for 2022.<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, the  regional conservation strategies also provide a framework for national  conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation  action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be  tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each  range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most  range states (dates of the initial planning workshop, and subsequent  action plan review, in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007, review  2018), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009, review 2018),  Zimbabwe (2009. Review 2018), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger  (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Malawi (2011);  Namibia (2013); Algeria (2015); Angola (2016); and Burkina Faso (2016).  In addition, Cheetah are included in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National  Conservation Action Plan (2010). These action plans cover nearly all the 30 Cheetah populations in Africa and 96% of known African Cheetah  range. Each national conservation action plan is published by government  wildlife authorities and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah  (and wild dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans  provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations  using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats and the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there  are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they  broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah  conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment  to Cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve  land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and  legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local  and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as  governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is  overseen by three CCI regional coordinators. There are also a number of  different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern  Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and  research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these  projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that  benefit Cheetah, and support for capacity development of national  wildlife authorities. The CCI is the only active cheetah conservation  program in northern, western or central Africa, but there are important  initiatives to safeguard protected areas in this region, including  efforts by African Parks to protect the WAP and Zakouma ecosystems.<br/><br/>The  recent CITES-CMS Africa Carnivore Initiative, adopted at the 12th  Conference of the Parties, provides a range of significant decisions to  improve the conservation status of Cheetah, along with the other three  focal threatened carnivores (see <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.cms.int/en/legalinstrument/african-carnivores-initiative"">https://www.cms.int/en/legalinstrument/african-carnivores-initiative</a>).<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected (Hunter <em>et al.</em>  2007a). Currently, the main protected areas for this species are Kavir  National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Miandasht Wildlife Refuge,  Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Darband e Ravar Wildlife Refuge, Dareh Anjir  Wildlife Refuge, Kamki Bahabad Hunting Prohibited Area and Ariz Hunting  Prohibited Area (Khalatbari <em>et al.</em> 2017). Additional small  protected areas predicted to have an important role in connecting  subpopulations should be subjected to more conservation (Ahmadi <em>et al.</em>  2017). Management of livestock in Cheetah habitats, recovery of prey  population and safeguarding roads are other most urgent conservation  measures that should be taken. The UNDP established a programme of work  to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah in 2001, and a  conservation planning workshop took place in 2010, leading to the  development of an action plan for the period of 2010 to 2014. Developing  a new and updated action plan considering the current circumstances is  recommended. UNDP has recently considered stopping their support for  this project, meaning that this project may continue only with national  budget. Considering limited budgets allocated for conservation projects  in Iran, this might be a serious threat to long term conservation of  Cheetah in Asia. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the  country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of  this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought  to be extinct in the country.<p></p><p></p>  <p></p>",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,False,False,Global
5068,259030422,15951,Panthera leo,Vulnerable,A2abcd,2024,2023-02-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Lion is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A2abcd based on an estimated 36% decline in the species' range over three generations (approximately 21 years) and therefore a similar population reduction is suspected.<br/><br/>Despite the Lion being well-studied, uncertainty remains a challenge in assessing this species (refer to the section on this topic under Population below for more detail). In recent years, considerable conservation effort has led to stable Lion populations in some areas and even species recovery in others (e.g., reintroductions into the Zambezi Delta in Mozambique, Akagera in Rwanda, and Zakouma National Park in Chad). However, over the last 21 years, declines in certain populations have also occurred (e.g., Limpopo National Park, Etosha National Park, and Niassa Game Reserve) with some areas experiencing local extinctions (e.g., Quirimbus National Park in Mozambique, Yankari Game Reserve in Nigeria (P. Funston pers. comm. 2023) and Toro-Semuliki Wildlife Reserve in Uganda). The present assessment is guided by the best available data and methods. Uncertainty is a common problem in the assessment of long-lived species where trends are assessed over a time span that either includes historical periods where some survey techniques were not yet available, or future periods that are inherently unpredictable.<br/><br/>Extant Lion range in 2023 is estimated to be 1,566,529.59 km², only 7.4% of its historical range. This is an estimated 36% range decline since 2002 (three Lion generations), where range was estimated to be 2,460,986 km². This decline, which is likely to continue, reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge.<br/><br/>A population of ~23,000 adult and subadult lions in Africa (African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023) and ~670 adult and subadult lions in India (Gujarat Forest Department 2020) was estimated for this assessment. This is an estimated decline from ~33,000 lions in 2006 (IUCN 2006 a, b), an estimated 30% decline in 17 years (i.e., less than three generations). The former figure shares a common background with Bauer <em>et al. </em>(2018), and the latter informed estimate in 2013 (Riggio <em>et al. </em>2013) show that these numbers are similar but with different reference years. These numbers all have extensive caveats, enormous uncertainty, and were partly based on differing methodologies; they cannot be used for a direct calculation of population trends, but they are consistent with the estimated range decline of 36%. Riggio <em>et al.</em> (2013) showed that declines in savanna habitat translate into declines in Lion numbers. Lindsey <em>et al.</em> (2017) showed that Lion densities vary substantially across their range, and that lions occur at levels below 50% of carrying capacity in two thirds of the sites they analysed. However, these sites were spread all over the African continent, and the range decline is also across the continent, so we have no reason to reject Lion range decline as a direct proxy for Lion population decline. This supporting evidence suggests that range declines equate proportionately to Lion population declines, and that range is an appropriate measure for our assessment. Therefore, this suspected decline of 36% in population is justified.<br/><br/>The previous Red List Assessment (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015) used a representative subset of estimates to infer a global population decline of 43%, albeit with regional variation. That same dataset was used in the same year with the same result, but with a much-improved methodology that involved Bayesian modelling to predict the probability of population decline (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015). This assessment used the same improved methodology to demonstrate the plausibility of our assessment (see the Population section for more details). In summary, using Bayesian modelling, we estimated Lion populations in Africa to have a 41% probability of declining by one third (33%) within three Lion generations (including past, present, and future), while this risk is estimated at 2% in India (Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). This supports a ≥30% reduction threshold for a Vulnerable listing for Lion. The probability of a 33% decline within three generations is estimated to be 74% in West Africa, 36% in East Africa, 33% in Central Africa, and 20% in Southern Africa (Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). However, while it demonstrates strong support for a Vulnerable listing, it cannot be used as a formal method to which we assess the species as this method is not fully consistent with the IUCN Red List Guidelines. <br/><br/>There are high threat levels across the species’ broad geographic range, with 12 recent extirpations and two suspected extirpations recorded (Table 2). However, it is encouraging to note that the number of extirpations has not increased since the previous (2015) assessment. The most important driver of Lion decline is habitat loss (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2020). Prey base depletion is also a significant driver and is partly linked to habitat loss, but more importantly to poaching and the bushmeat trade (Becker <em>et al. </em>2013). Human–Lion conflict, which results in the indiscriminate killing of lions in defence of human life and livestock, is another major threat to the species (Sibanda <em>et al.</em> 2021). The trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, both within Africa and in Asia (Williams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017,&#160;Mole and Newton 2020, Coals&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022) is an emerging threat. Furthermore, although trophy hunting can contribute positively to Lion conservation, improvements in management practices of this practice have been recommended (Edwards&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2019), as when poorly regulated, it also contributes to population declines (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2009, Croes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;Rosenblatt <em>et al.</em> 2014, Loveridge&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2023). Poorly regulated trophy hunting has been previously highlighted as a threat to lions, however, attempts have been made to mitigate through the implementation of science-based management practices. Populations that are trophy hunted should be effectively monitored to ensure that there are no negative population impacts. The impact of violent extremism in several parts of Lion ranges in Africa (Lhoest <em>et al.</em> 2022) is likely to further drive the declining nature of lions in these regions. The increasing number of lions poached for their body parts in Mozambique (African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023; Mole and Newton 2020) is of concern, but this presently appears to be confined to this region (Coals <em>et al.</em> 2020), however, illegal trade is reported in at least six African countries (see CITES CoP 17 Prop. 4).<br/><br/>Given the evidence of ongoing and increasing threats to lions across much of their fragmented range, we recommend that the Lion is a species under observation and its threat status is closely monitored, with a reassessment after a minimum three-year period or as soon as new information emerges.<br/><br/>This decline in both population and range, which is likely to continue, reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge. This meets the requirements for listing as Vulnerable (A2abcd).","The African Lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara Desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of Lion at elevations of more than 4,000 m asl in the Bale Mountains in Ethiopia and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania; (West and Packer 2013). Although lions drink regularly when water is available, they can obtain their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the Tsama Melon in the Kalahari Desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments.<br/>&#160;<br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Prides can vary in size and up to 30 individuals have been observed in larger ecosystems, although the average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults (Smuts 1976). In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (South Africa/Botswana) it was found that the average pride size was 11.3 ± 1.1 individuals for prides in the park; similar in size to other areas (11.8 individuals in Kruger National Park, 12.5 in Etosha National Park (Funston 2011)).<br/><br/>Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g., from 266–4,532 km² in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001). Across regions, Lion home ranges can also vary significantly. For example, Lion home ranges in Tarangire National Park in Tanzania can range between 52–616 km² (Laizer<em> et al. </em>2014). In contrast, in more arid environments such as Etosha National Park, home ranges up to 2,075 km² have been recorded (Stander 1991). <br/><br/>Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra, and wildebeest) make up large portions of lion’s prey base (Hayward and Kerley 2005), but lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to rhinos. Out of the five preferred prey species in Southern Africa (Hayward <em>et al. </em>2007), three historically never occurred in West and Central Africa and Giraffe are rare in that region, leaving only Buffalo but even that species is notably smaller there. Instead, medium sized species such as Kob (<em>Kobus kob</em>) are the preferred prey in West and Central Africa (Bodendorfer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Bauer <em>et al. </em>2008, Tumenta <em>et al. </em>2013). Some Lion populations have adapted to specialize in unique prey species within their own environments, such as Elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) in the Chobe (Power and Compion 2009) and in Hwange (Loveridge <em>et al.</em> 2006), and Cape Fur Seals (<em>Artocephalus pusillus</em>) on the Skeleton Coast in Namibia (Stander 2019). Lions will also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena, <em>Crocuta Crocuta</em>, and Cheetah, <em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>) from their kills.<br/><br/>In India, Asiatic lions prefer the most mesic and thick canopy forest vegetation available to them in the dry deciduous forests of Gir (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2009). The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock (Meena <em>et al.</em> 2014). Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic lion's diet, although the Chital Deer (<em>Axis axis</em>) is the most common prey species. Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African lions: most Gir prides range between two and eleven adult females (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2009).","The main threats to lions include continued habitat loss and conversion of safe space. This has led to several subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer <em>et al. </em>2008, 2020). Other significant threats include indiscriminate killing (primarily due to retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect human life and livestock), and prey base depletion (Wolf and Ripple 2016). In recent years the targeted poaching for parts (Everatt <em>et al. </em>2019, African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023) and violent extremism/warfare (Lhoest <em>et al. </em>2022) have emerged as significant threats to the species. Furthermore, while trophy hunting has a net positive impact in some areas, it may, at times, contributed to local population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014). In general, there seem to be an increasing number of lions poached through snaring and targeted poaching in many areas across the species range (e.g., the Greater Kruger, Zambeze Delta, Niassa Reserve, Waza National Park, and WAP complex (African Lion Database, unpub. data. 2023)).<br/><strong><br/>Conflict</strong><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant. Patterson <em>et al. </em>(2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses, amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer, 2003). Generally, economic losses caused by lions are among some of the highest reported in East Africa when compared to other wildlife species (Muriuki <em>et al. </em>2017). Consequently, lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. However, some case studies exist. For example, Hazzah <em>et al.</em> (2014) estimated that on average, 12.5 Lions were killed per year between 2003 and 2008 by residents of Olgulului Group Range in Kenya. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Hazzah <em>et al. </em>2014). For example, Sibanda <em>et al.</em> (2021) studied Lion conflict in three communal areas in northwestern Zimbabwe (~3,306 km²) and recorded 46 lions killed between 2008 and 2017. Following the implementation of livestock protection strategies, livestock losses generally decreased, and the number of lions killed per year declined by 41 % (Sibanda <em>et al. </em>2021).<br/><br/><strong>Prey depletion</strong><br/>Prey depletion is generally defined as the substantial decline in prey abundance, and its effect on the survival and reproduction of lions is still fairly under-studied (Vinks <em>et al.</em> 2021). Generally, prey depletion reduces an area’s carrying capacity, which therefore reduces Lion density without necessarily reducing their survival rates (Vinks <em>et al.</em> 2021). Lion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007, van Orsdol 1984). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey<em> et al. </em>2013). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West (Ripple <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is likely that these declines have been even more dramatic since the publication of this study, although precise data is lacking.<br/><br/><strong>Bycatch in snares</strong><br/>Wire snare poaching is widespread throughout much of the species’ range. Snares are generally set in an effort for to capture species for bushmeat, although lions are not commonly targeted. However, lions are often captured in snares intended for other species (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2013, Everatt <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bauer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This threat has the potential to result in severe population declines of all large carnivores if not mitigated accordingly. For example, Becker <em>et al.</em> (2013) found that ~11.5% of the adult and subadult lion population and 20% of the adult (&gt;4 years) males within the population were snared at some point (82% were treated and recovered).<br/><br/><strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>While there has historically been some level of illegal trade and use of Lion bones and body parts for traditional medicine, this threat has escalated in recent years and has emerged in several countries within the species range (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2017, Everatt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019,&#160;Coals&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2022). More information on this threat can be found under the Use and Trade section above.<br/><strong><br/>Trophy hunting</strong><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in several sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land, providing financial resources for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities (Holechek and Valdez 2018). However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male Lion per 2,000 km² has been recommended (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat&#160; (Lindsey<em> et al.</em> 2013b) to continued survival of lions in these areas. Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Loveridge <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2023; Packer <em>et al. </em>2011). Hunter <em>et al. </em>(2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts on wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching, and tolerance of lions outside protected areas.<br/><strong><br/>Violent extremism and warfare</strong><br/>There are often unforeseen and dramatic consequences and severe environmental impacts resulting from violent extremism adjacent to protected areas (Bouley <em>et al</em>. 2018, Lhoest <em>et al</em>. 2022). Several protected areas (e.g., W-Arly-Pendjari complex, Niassa) within Lion range are under pressure from rebel groups or violent extremist organisations. Unsafe areas resulting from such threats, makes conservation action and protected area management challenging. Protected areas which are occupied by such groups generally lack park management, see increased and unmanaged livestock invasion, suffer habitat loss due to increased crop planting and experience increased bushmeat poaching. <br/><br/>This threat needs to be particularly highlighted in the W-Arly-Pendjari complex (Burkina Faso, Niger and Benin). The W-Arly-Pendjari complex has the last remaining stronghold for lions in West and Central Africa. With the WAP being under severe threat from extremist groups in Niger and Burkina Faso, it places significant threat on this vital remaining population of lions. Supporting this claim is the fact that aerial survey reports in W Park in Burkina Faso, which is currently occupied by extremist groups, indicate that the area is devoid of any large mammalian wildlife (Ouindeyama&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, Lhoest <em>et al. </em>2022). While lions may still occur throughout the complex, if the situation in the complex remains unchanged, this population may likely become significantly reduced, if not extinct altogether.<br/><strong><br/>Other</strong><br/>We expect that climate change will likely have a negative impact on the species; however, the extent of this impact is largely unknown. <br/><br/>The lack of sufficient funding to support protected areas with lions poses a significant challenge to their successful conservation (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2018). It has been estimated that protected areas with lions require between $1,000 to $2,000/km² annually to be managed effectively, yet receive, on average, $200/km² annually (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2018). Nearly all protected areas in Africa with lions are inadequately funded, with deficits totally $0.9 to $2.1 billion.","<strong>Abundance </strong><br/>For this assessment, we do not aim to provide a new estimate of total Lion numbers. Determining a population number for lions is incredibly challenging as most populations have yet to be surveyed and population numbers that may exist are based on guesses or extrapolations. In addition, some surveys are outdated. For this assessment, to determine a global population number, we used the latest population estimates published in the Guidelines for the Conservation of Lions in Africa (GCLA, Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2018), and where possible, updated those figures from the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group’s African Lion Database (ALD) where more recent surveys have been completed. Caution must be exercised when using these figures and inferring trends based on these data presented in the GCLA due to various data limitations. Considering the difficulty in interpreting Lion numbers and the availability of an alternative, we decided not to base this assessment on total population numbers. Though our knowledge of the Lion distribution has improved with time, it is still limited at the national, regional, and range-wide scales because reliable data on Lion population trends are missing from large portions of their range, particularly those in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>The estimate Lion population size in Africa is ~23,000 including subadult and adult lions (Bauer<em> et al.</em>, 2018, African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023; Supplementary Information Table 4) and ~670 subadult and adult lions in India (Gujarat Forest Department 2020). The largest proportion of Africa’s lions are found in Southern Africa 47.55%, with 46.54% in East Africa, 4.82% Central African and 1.07% in West Africa. Between 2006 and 2018, the Lion population in Africa was estimated to have declined by 25% over 12 years from 33,292 to 25,105 (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2018). In this assessment we estimate a decline of 8% from ~25,105 in 2018 to ~23,000 in 2023. Although in the past decade, Lion populations seem to be increasing in many of their Southern African ranges, there are indications of a general population decline across its total range with the biggest assumed declines in West and Central Africa.<br/>&#160; <br/>Several subpopulations have been stable, among them the only remaining subpopulation in Asia (surviving in the Gir Forest area of Gujarat, India) and several subpopulations in Southern Africa—especially those in fenced, well-protected reserves. Subpopulations appear to be stable where management is sufficiently funded with fencing being one of several effective conservation management techniques (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, di Minin <em>et al. </em>2021). However, many Lion subpopulations occur in areas where management budgets insufficient (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2018, Robson <em>et al.</em> 2022), leading to local declines and even extinction (e.g., West Africa; Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Little is known about Lion subpopulations in Angola, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, and South Sudan, but these are assumed to be declining based on the limited data available from these areas and the conservation challenges in these areas (e.g., political instability).<br/><br/>While lions qualify as Vulnerable, it is of great concern that parts of the African population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the category for Endangered – particularly in West Africa. Since the sample subpopulations were all monitored, an even greater average rate of decline is likely for unmonitored subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation and mitigation effort.<br/><strong><br/>Bayesian Modelling</strong><br/>A Bayesian state space model to estimate the growth rate-λ of each subpopulation was completed following the methods in Bauer <em>et al. </em>(2015). While this model demonstrates strong support for a Vulnerable listing, it cannot be used as a formal method to which we assess the species as this method is not fully consistent with the IUCN Red List Guidelines. <br/><br/>Data from relatively well-studied Lion subpopulations were used with additional unpublished data provided by contributors (Supplementary Information Table 4). Population estimates were obtained by commonly used scientific research methods including total counts, individual identification, total or sample inventory using calling stations, radio telemetry, photographic databases, and density estimates based on direct observations (Supplementary Information Table 5 and 6). Population estimates were excluded for sites based on extrapolation of densities from other areas, or informed estimates by researchers. The minimum number of surveys per site over the assessment period was two, but some sites were monitored more regularly.<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations (or ten years, whatever is longer) as the relevant time span for trend assessment. A Lion generation length of 6.98 years (three generations = 21 years) was used for the modelling (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). Subpopulations were first categorized individually and then according to region. The mean of the regional values was used to determine a continental result for Africa and India (Supplementary Information Table 1 and 6). However, because the two continental results were significantly different, their mean could not be used to estimate a global probability of population trend.<br/><br/>To assess population trends a Bayesian hierarchical state space model was used to estimate the growth rate-λ of each population (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015). Fifty-six unweighted posterior density distributions of growth rate (one per population) were summed across three sets to provide geographic conservation-relevant estimates of demographic trends. The four African regions defined by the IUCN regional Lion conservation strategies constituted four sets (Bauer <em>et al. </em>2015). The projected probability of decline over T years by 33% and 50% (see supplementary material for formulas and Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015) for each population was estimated (Supplementary Information Tables 1 and 2) without making inferences on true population size N, with T equal to 7 (one generation), 14 (two generations) and 21 years (three generations).<br/><br/>The summed posterior densities of growth rates for regional groups showed that, the West African populations were sharply declining λ = 0.87 ± 0.25 (Supplementary Figure S1), Central African populations were slightly increasing λ = 1.02 ± 0.18 (Supplementary Figure S2) while East African populations were stable λ = 1 ± 0.15 (Supplementary Figure S3). Southern African populations were by contrast, increasing λ = 1.07 ± 0.17 (Supplementary Figure S4).<br/><br/>The models estimated that the West African group had the highest probability of declining by one third in three lion generations of 0.74, followed by the Central African group (0.33), the East African group (0.36) and the Southern African group (0.20; Supporting Information Table 1). At a continental African level, the Lion population has a 41% probability of declining by 33% (one third) within three Lion generations, while we estimate that probability to be 2% in India.<br/><br/>Models estimate the probability of meeting the thresholds for lower or higher categories (Near Threatened or Endangered) is lower than 41% and thus lions do not qualify for these categories. The threshold for Endangered under Criterion A is a 50% population size decline over three generations. The probability of such a decline is estimated to be 72% in West Africa, 29% in Central Africa, 30% in East Africa, 17% in Southern Africa and 2% in India (Table 1). Therefore, only West Africa would qualify as Endangered. The Lion subpopulation in West Africa has been classified as Regionally Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(ii) in 2014 (Henschel <em>et al. </em>2014), which is supported in the current analysis. It is vital that more Lion areas are surveyed rigorously, and that urgent conservation priority should be placed on West Africa. Based on our analysis, lions qualify as Vulnerable, but it is of great concern that parts of the African population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the category of Endangered. Since the sample subpopulations were all monitored, an even greater average rate of decline is likely for unmonitored subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation effort. Finally, trends inferred are from a small proportion of Lion populations, given so few populations are subject to regular surveys; there is therefore a chance that they may not be representative of most populations, for which data is lacking (see Figure S6 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to uncertainty and data limitations</strong><br/>Due to insufficient confidence in earlier or recent species population estimates, they cannot be employed to estimate overall, real-time trends, as such, groupings of scientific time series site estimates have been used as a proxy. Although these data are more numerous for lions than for other big <em>Panthera</em> cats, there is still considerable uncertainty inherent in both the data (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015) and the treatment of it to estimate species population trend.<br/><br/>The difficulties in comparing survey data are recognized. In some cases, survey methods varied between years, and for some surveys accuracy may have been low, but the complete data set shows an obvious trend that is unlikely to be an artefact of methodological insufficiencies. There is inherent bias when using survey data as these often come from well-monitored areas with some element of protection and limited anthropogenic threat pressure (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Bauer <em>et al. </em>2015). This could bias overall results to a more optimistic state as declining populations do not necessarily have supporting data due to limited monitoring on the ground (See Figure S6 in Supplementary information). For example, the data available for the Burkina Faso component of the W-Arly-Penjari Complex indicates a steady, but slow, increase in population size between 2012 and 2015. However, due to the recent and ongoing violent extremist presence in the area (Lhoest <em>et al.</em> 2022), protected area management is no longer present – offering little protection to species. This is very likely to have resulted in population declines of all wildlife, including lions (as explained in the Threat Section below). However, due to the simple fact that conducting rigorous surveys on the ground is near impossible, population data to support the well-based assumption that this subpopulation is declining are not available. As a result, it is assumed that a more optimistic view on regional trends is presented here (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2015). Robust and regular surveys must be carried out in future that promote more reliable assessments of trends.<br/><strong><br/>Fenced Reserves</strong><br/>Another aspect of the assessment that needs to be documented is our treatment of small, fenced reserves in Southern Africa (specifically South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Malawi). Most of the population increases have occurred in these areas where management practices include translocations and reintroductions. It must be noted that South African Reserves that have a contracepted population have not been included in our estimates. In South Africa, there are 50 small, fenced reserves that are represented as one subpopulation that we refer to as South Africa’s Managed Metapopulation (J. Selier pers. comm. 2022). Such management decisions should consider the ‘type, scale, frequency, and effects of the suite of management interventions’ and could be taxon specific (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2015). Management of lions in the concerned areas aims to mimic natural processes and to retain adaptive potential and follows a nationally coordinated meta-population management approach (Mallon and Stanley Price 2013, Hayward&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). It is further recognized that fences have been documented as effective tools in Lion conservation (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2013). Thus, these populations are 'lightly managed' as defined in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2022) and that they can therefore be considered ""wild"" and are therefore included in the assessment.<strong><br/></strong>",Decreasing,"Lions are the carnivores that have undergone the largest range contraction, with about 85% of Lion range lost since CE 1500 (Morrison <em>et al</em>. 2007). Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Lion formerly ranged from North Africa through Southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe (where it became extinct almost 2,000 years ago), and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Today, the only remainder of this once widespread northern population is a single isolated subpopulation in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary and the surrounding landscape in India. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer 2013).<br/><br/>Lion distribution was assessed using the Lion distribution map created and maintained by the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group’s African Lion Database (ALD). The ALD is used to provide a continually updated assessment of the abundance and distribution of lions in Africa. Based on the data in the ALD, regional maps were generated, and adjustments made based on feedback from country experts. Where new data were lacking, the 2015 Red List Assessment and the IUCN Cat Specialist Group’s Guidelines for the Conservation of lions in Africa (IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group 2018) were used as both have been through a peer-review process. Repeated observation data from areas previously considered as out-of-range were obtained. These areas do not necessarily indicate range expansion since the last assessment, but rather more accurate data. Such areas include: Luando area in Angola (J. Anderson pers. comm. 2019), the Mpem and Djem area in Cameroon (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2019), the northern boundary of Central Kalahari Game Reserve in Botswana (A. Loveridge pers. comm. 2022), additional wildlife management areas in the Okavango (A. Stein pers. comm. 2022; A. Albertson pers. comm. 2019), Southern National Park in South Sudan (M. Moeller pers. comm. 2022), Zeraf area in South Sudan (R. Gony pers. comm. 2023), Erindi Private Game Reserve in Namibia; (Erindi PGR, unpub. data 2020), various hunting concessions in Mozambique (e.g., in Tete Province; R. Lovemore pers. comm. 2022; Rio Save Safaris Lda, unpub. data 2022) and Chad (African Parks, unpub. data. 2022) and several game reserves in South Africa (SANBI, unpub. data. 2022). However, some areas do reflect an increase in range due to the successful reintroductions of lions into fenced areas (e.g., fenced reserves in South Africa, Liwonde and Majete in Malawi, Akagera in Rwanda).<br/><br/>Several amendments were made to this assessment’s distribution map that were not accurately captured in the previous assessment. These are as follows:<br/><ol><li>The Benoué Complex in Cameroon was previously incorrectly mapped. This has been corrected to include the surrounding concessions that are included in the complex and are known Lion range.</li><li>Bubye Valley Conservancy in Zimbabwe was previously incorrectly mapped (in terms of size and location) and this has been corrected.</li><li>An expansive range in the Northern Cape Province in South Africa was removed as it was depicted as Lion range, but was inaccurate as no known Lion population has existed there. </li><li>Coutada 9 in Mozambique was included as it was previously not mapped.</li><li>Revision of range in Ethiopia following Yirga <em>et al.</em> (2021) and Gebretensae and Kebede (2022).</li></ol><br/>Furthermore, some of the mapped subpopulations are in areas where armed conflict may have had an impact on Lion persistence (e.g., Central African Republic and South Sudan). Until proof to the contrary and based on the lack of recent data to confirm Lion presence, we therefore classified such areas as “Possibly Extinct” but maintained Protected Areas as Lion range (including many large hunting concessions, such as in the Central African Republic). Some of the areas currently mapped as “Possibly Extinct” could contain relict Lion subpopulations and should be prioritized for field surveys (e.g., large areas in South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Somalia) aimed at establishing Lion status.<br/><br/>Finally, to account for recent loss of habitat in areas where data are lacking, continental Lion range was overlaid with a cropland layer obtained from the ESA WorldCover V2 2021 product (<a href=""https://esa-worldcover.org/en"">https://esa-worldcover.org/en</a>). Areas of at least 100 km² of continuous range that consisted of over 50% cropland were reclassified from “Extant” to “Possibly Extinct”, as it is unlikely that such areas still sustain resident Lion populations.<br/><br/>Lions are difficult to survey, and knowledge of Lion numbers and distribution is limited. Therefore, Lion researchers have worked with two metrics: known or extant Lion range, where Lion presence has been confirmed, and possible or possibly extant Lion range, where Lion presence is suspected. Lions were once widely distributed across Africa and Asia, but populations have become reduced and isolated, and they are now extirpated from large portions of their historic range. In Supporting Online Information Table 3 we present the range figures from 2002, 2005, 2016, and 2023. We estimate extant Lion range in 2023 to be 1,566,529.59 km², or 7.4% of historical range. This is a 33% decline from 2005, and a decline of 36% over three Lion generations. This range reduction reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge. <br/><br/>In West Africa, lions are largely confined to small populations (&lt;50 individuals) in Niokolo-Koba (Senegal), and Yankari and Kainji Lake National Parks (Nigeria) with the largest population (estimated 187 lions) in the W-Arly-Penjari Complex (Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger). In Central Africa, lions are found within the Bénoué Complex and Waza National Park in Cameroon. Dispersed individuals have been found south of Bénoué, around Mpem and Djem National Park, and in Sena Oura National Park in Chad. Zakouma National Park and the surrounding areas have the largest population of lions in Chad. There is more uncertainty around the exact presence of lions in both the Central African Republic and South Sudan. In the Central African Republic, they are found in some of the national parks, including Bamingui-Bangoran National Park, Andre Felix National Park, Yata-Ngaya Faunal Reserve, and the Chinko Conservation Area (CCA). The latter is believed to have the largest population, estimated at ~150 lions (T. Aebischer pers. comm. 2023). Based on conservation projects in the area, it can be assumed that the CCA is the only place in eastern Central African Republic where the Northern Lion population is increasing, in all other areas it is likely stable or more likely decreasing, locally even dramatically (T. Aebischer pers. comm. 2023). In South Sudan there are small populations throughout the country confirmed in Southern National Park, Badingilo National Park, Zaref Game Reserve, and Boma National Park. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there are two populations, one in Garamba National Park and the surrounding hunting complex (and extending into Lantoto in South Sudan) and Virunga National Park.<br/><br/>In East Africa, lions are found in several areas in Ethiopia—although there is considerable uncertainty regarding their extent. Populations of lions occur in Uganda (including Queen Elizabeth National Park, Murchison National Park and Kidepo Valley). In Rwanda, one small, reintroduced population (&lt;50 individuals) is found in Akagera National Park. Lions have significantly larger distributions in both Kenya and Tanzania, where they are found in most National Parks, protected areas, and hunting concessions. However, range in Tanzania has been reduced due to the increasing conversion of habitat into agricultural land. Field surveys for many areas of Tanzania are also still lacking. In Somalia there have been some reports of Lion presence, but there is no tangible evidence to support this, thus this range is assigned to the uncertain category.<br/><br/>In Southern Africa, lions occur in multiple fenced reserves in Malawi, where they have been reintroduced (each population &lt;50 lions). In Zambia, lions are found in Kafue, Liuwa Plains National Park, Sioma Ngwezi National Park and within the South Luangwa Valley. Lions are believed to have been recently extirpated from Northern Zambia. Within Namibia, lions are found in Etosha National Park, up the Skeleton Coast, and the Kunene and Caprivi regions. South Africa’s largest Lion populations are in the Transfrontier parks of Kruger and Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, as well as a large managed metapopulation network of fenced reserves. In Botswana, they are found in the Central Kalahari and the Okavango-Delta region. The largest population in Zimbabwe occurs in the Hwange ecosystem. In addition, lions also occur in Gonarezhou National Park and the surrounding areas (including Savé Valley Conservancy and in Bubye Valley Conservancy, a large fenced protected area). Lions also occur in northern Zimbabwe in the Zambezi Valley protected area complex bordering Zambia and protected areas south of Lake Kariba. In Mozambique, lions have been extirpated from much of their range (including Quirimbus National Park and the Tete Province). The largest population (&gt;800 lions) within the country occurs in Niassa Reserve. In addition, lions occur in the Zambezi Delta, extending north towards Coutada 9, Limpopo National Park, Lebombo Conservancy, Zinave National Park, and a restricted area south of the Tete Province. <br/><br/>The global population of lions is highly fragmented (Loveridge <em>et al.</em> 2022). This is especially true in West Africa were the seven subpopulations (Niokola-Koba, WAP, Yankari Game Reserve, Kainji Lake, Waza National Park, Benoué Complex and Mpem and Djem) are all considered to be isolated from one another. In Central and East Africa, various populations are also fragmented.","<strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>Illegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit (IUCN 2006a) and control (IUCN 2006b) trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). Traditional medicinal practices in Africa and Asia are perceived to be the main uses that Lion body parts and bones are required (Williams<em> et al.</em> 2017). Specific parts such as skin, claws, teeth, and bones are the most in demand parts (Williams<em> et al. </em>2017, African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023). However, other parts such as tails, reproductive parts and internal organs are also harvested (African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023). <br/><br/>While there has historically been some level of illegal trade and use of Lion bones and body parts for traditional medicine, this threat has escalated in recent years and has emerged in several countries within the species range (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2017; Everatt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019; Coals&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, 2022). In Mozambique the targeted poaching of lions and suspected poaching incidences are high, accounting for 74% and 48% of anthropogenic Lion mortalities in Niassa and Limpopo National Park respectively, with evidence of domestic, regional, and international trade of Lion parts and derivatives (Everatt <em>et al</em>. 2019, Mole and Newton 2020). In South Africa, lions within captive facilities are intentionally killed (generally poisoned) for body parts, presumably to sell to international markets.<br/><br/>The increase in the number of lions killed in Mozambique for their parts is of particular concern (African Lion Database, unpub. data 2023) and may cause the Lion subpopulations within the country to decline. However, there is currently little evidence of this threat being a major concern in other areas across their range.",Terrestrial,"Since 1975 <em>Panthera leo</em> has been included in CITES Appendix II, and the Endangered Asiatic Lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica </em>in CITES Appendix I.<br/><br/>In Africa, lions are present in numerous large and well-managed protected areas (Nicolson <em>et al.</em>&#160;in prep., Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2018, Loveridge <em>et al.</em> 2022), and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa (Nzomo <em>et al.</em> 2020). Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way, lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for lions in West and Central Africa (IUCN 2006a, Funston <em>et al</em>. 2023) and Eastern and Southern Africa (IUCN 2006b). However, these are almost 20 years old and need to be reviewed and potentially updated. By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of Lion status and management (IUCN 2006a, b; IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group 2007, 2018; Bauer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). While all these documents show awareness of the threats and recognition of solutions, the continued decline in Lion range and numbers show that political priority and funding are not sufficient&#160; (Lindsey<em> et al.</em> 2018, Packer <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Key conservation efforts should include effective protected area management including funding (Lindsey&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, 2021;&#160;Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2020; Robson <em>et al.</em> 2022), mitigating anthropogenic causes of mortality such as Lion-human conflict (Bauer <em>et al. </em>2020, Sibanda <em>et al.</em> 2021) and snaring (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2013), and reducing or mitigating the negative effects of armed conflict (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2020, Lhoest <em>et al.</em> 2022).<br/><br/>With the Lion currently listed as Critically Endangered in West Africa and with declining populations within the region, urgent conservation action is required to prevent local extinctions of this subspecies within the region.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan,,False,False,Global
